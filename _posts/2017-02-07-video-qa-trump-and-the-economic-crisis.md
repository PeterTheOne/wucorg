<h2>TRANSCRIPT</h2>

This is a fantastic opportunity for Americans to learn some German; the first word they should look up is 'Schadenfreude,' as their hopes and dreams of "draining the swamp" are crushed by a completely sold-out establishment politician. I've spent the last six months telling people all around the world that Trump was going to win and no one would believe me. Was this a failure of politics or economics? 

The U.S. political system failed because the economy failed. Bitcoin is providing an honest market solution; the reason it's being used as an exit is because it offers the real market value for your currency exchange when the other markets have been artificially shut off.
