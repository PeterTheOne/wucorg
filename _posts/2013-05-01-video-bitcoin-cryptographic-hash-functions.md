<p>Saying that a <a href="/hashflare-cloud-mining-review/">cryptographic hash function need</a> be Computationally Efficient seems confusing to me. In fact, the more efficient it is, it opens the door to brute force reversal of the function. Wouldn't it be more precise to say that the ratio of the difficulty of computing the reverse function, is as great as possible?</p>

<p>For example, BCrypt and SCrypt are specifically designed to be inefficient to compute in some way to thwart brute force attacks (as is the PBKDF2 protocol for wrapping an efficient hash function in a way to make it less efficient to compute).</p>
