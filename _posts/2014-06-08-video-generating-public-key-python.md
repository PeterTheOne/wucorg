<p>Welcome to part four in our series on Elliptic Curve Cryptography. In this episode we dive into the development of the public key. In just 44 lines of code, with no special functions or imports, we produce the elliptic curve public key for <a href="/how-use-bitcoin-anonymously/">use in Bitcoin</a>. Better still, we walk you through it line by line, constant by constant. Nothing makes the process clearer and easier to understand than seeing it in straight forward code. If you've been wondering about the secp256k1 (arguably the most important piece of code in Bitcoin), well then this is the video for you.</p>
