The [TREZOR](/trezor-review-bitcoin-hardware-wallet/) was the first [hardware wallet](/en/find-the-best-bitcoin-wallet/) with a screen. It's a mini computer that makes secure [cold storage](/bitcoin-cold-storage-guide/) easy for the average Bitcoin user.

The TREZOR's screen means it can be used on any computer, even one that has been hacked or infected with malware.  

## Slush Pool - Mining Pool

Slush Pool was the first Bitcoin mining pool. To date, it has mined nearly one million bitcoins. It currently [controls](https://www.bitcoinmining.com/bitcoin-mining-pools/) about 6% of the Bitcoin network hash rate. 

Slush Pool is unique, as it is one of the only mining pools that allows individual miners to [show support](https://slushpool.com/stats/) for different Bitcoin Improvement Proposals. 

## Coinmap - Bitcoin Merchant Directory

[Coinmap](https://coinmap.org/welcome/) makes it easy to find [Bitcoin merchants](/en/merchant-tools/) around the world. It is a searchable directory and map, and new merchants can submit stores to the database. Users can also leave public feedback to alert other customers of problems or good experiences.
