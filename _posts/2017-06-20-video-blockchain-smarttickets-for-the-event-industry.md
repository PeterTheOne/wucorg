<p>EventChain will provide a simple user interface for event managers to manage and execute Smart Ticket sales globally for small to large events supported by the underlying blockchain technology and our unique decentralized token, EventCoin (EVC token), empowering a true peer-to-peer network for buying and selling tickets to events.</p>

<p>EventChain has the opportunity of becoming the first real world blockchain application that is widely adopted by the general public without any need to understand the underlying distributed technology.</p>
