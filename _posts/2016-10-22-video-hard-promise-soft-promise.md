<p>This talk took place on September 20th 2016 at the @SFBTCMeetup in San Francisco, California. Are bitcoin payments irreversible? Many have criticized this as a "problem" for consumers. Some have gone as far as to <a href="/dubai-to-host-a-new-world-blockchain-forum/">design blockchains</a> that are editable and give authority to a group to reverse transactions. In this talk, Andreas dissects the concept of irreversible agreements, hard promises and soft promises and the ties they have to systems of authority and autonomy.</p>
