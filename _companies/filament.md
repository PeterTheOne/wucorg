At <a href="https://filament.com/">Filament</a>, our core design principles are security, privacy, device autonomy, fully decentralized communication, and the free exchange of value.

Applying these principles to low-power devices and long-range communication makes the Filament technology stack the ideal solution for industrial IoT applications.

## Security

We use modern cryptographic protocols and defense in depth to help ensure that information is not disclosed to unauthorized entities and not modified in an unauthorized or accidental manner.

## Privacy

Our privacy-enhancing techniques (such as device communities) help to prevent attackers from learning information about device interactions.

## Autonomy

On Filament networks, devices are first-class citizens and can interact and exchange value without the involvement of a server or a connection to the cloud.

## Decentralization

Remote locations and private networks are straightforward with Filament technologies. Plus security and resilience are improved when devices do not require a server in order to communicate.

## Exchange

Value can be exchanged between devices in the form of data, network access, currencies such as Bitcoin, compute cycles, contracts for ongoing service, trusted introductions to other devices, and more.
