Bitstamp is a Bitcoin exchange based in the United Kingdom. Nejc Kodriƒç and Damijan Merlak, two early Bitcoin users from Slovenia, founded the exchange in 2011.

## Trading

When it launched, Bitstamp became the first major alternative to now failed [Bitcoin exchange](/en/how-buy-bitcoins-online-best-bitcoin-exchange-rate-bitcoin-price/) Mt. Gox. 

Bitstamp's main product is its USD/BTC exchange, where it handles [about 7%](http://data.bitcoinity.org/markets/volume/30d/USD?c=e&t=a) of global USD / Bitcoin trading volume. 

## Hack

In January 2015, Bitstamp [lost $5 million](http://www.coindesk.com/bitstamp-claims-roughly-19000-btc-lost-hot-wallet-hack/) (slightly less than 19,000 BTC) in a hack on its hot wallet. The exchange later claimed that user funds were not affected and that all balances would be honored. 

## European License

In [April 2016](http://www.coindesk.com/bitstamp-license-europe/), Bitstamp became the first Bitcoin exchange to be granted a license to become a fully regulated payment institution in Europe. With the license, Bitstamp [launched](https://www.bitstamp.net/article/bitstamp-first-nationally-licensed-btc-exchange/) its BTC/EUR trading pair. 

## Gold Exchange

Bitstamp [announced](https://www.bitstamp.net/article/exchange-bitcoins-gold/) a partnership with gold exchange MORO in October, 2015. The partnership allows Bitstamp customers to withdrawal funds from the exchange in the form of gold. The 20 gram gold bars are shipped free of charge and delivery is fully insured.
