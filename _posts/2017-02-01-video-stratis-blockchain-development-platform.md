<h2>TRANSCRIPT</h2>

Stratis is a powerful and flexible blockchain development platform designed for the needs of real-world financial services, businesses and other organizations that want to develop, test and deploy applications on the blockchain.

Stratis blockchain apps can be developed in pure C# and can also utilize the .NET framework.

One of the most important advantages that C# has is that it is a part of the .NET Core platform. 

This platform allows you to write code that works on Windows, Mac, Android, etc.

In theory, this may allow functionality like letting you run a full bitcoin node on your phone, among other new possibilities.

Stratis significantly simplifies the development process for creating blockchain applications and accelerates the development lifecycle for blockchain development projects.
