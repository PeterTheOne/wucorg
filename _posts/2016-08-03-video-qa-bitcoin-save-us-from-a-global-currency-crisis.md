<p> I'm perplexed by people in this community who think Bitcoin would thrive in a time of chaos and collapse. I've lived in a country with a currency crisis (twice) and a lot of really good people get hurt; we shouldn't be wishing for that. Bitcoin is not ready to absorb a global economic crisis. Unfortunately the system is very fragile and there's a good chance it could happen. Just because Bitcoin can act as a safe-haven investment, as an exit valve, just because <a href="/fintech-will-be-merged-sooner-than-we-think-bitcoin-etf/">Bitcoin spikes</a> during events like Brexit or the yuan devaluation -- there's a big leap between that and "I hope the world burns so I make more on my bitcoins."</p>
