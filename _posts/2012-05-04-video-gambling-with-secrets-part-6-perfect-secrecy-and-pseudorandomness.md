<p>This chapter introduces why random shifts result in perfect secrecy. We explore hardware random number generators vs. pseudorandom number generators which expand a short random seed into a long sequences of "random looking" numbers. If used in cryptography, can offer "practical security" which is based on the secrecy of the random seed only. Alice and Bob can safely assume that the "enemy knows the system" (one-time pad + pseudorandom generator), and focus on assuring their seed is shared in secret & generated randomly.</p>
