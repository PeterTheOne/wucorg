<p>BCash, BCH, BCC or sometimes called Bitcoin Cash is a <a href="/video-digital-currency-mainstream/">digital currency</a> that has been created using a fork of the Bitcoin Network. If you were holding Bitcoin during the time of the fork (August 1, 2017),  you also have an equivalent BCash in the forked BCash blockchain.</p>

<p>To answer a long debate in the Bitcoin community regarding Bitcoin’s best way of scaling unto more users, BCash came into life. In the <a href="/video-bitcoin-coding-block-header/">Bitcoin codebase</a> the best and simple solution being followed is to increase the Max Block size Limit parameter. </p>

{% include page-toc.html %}

<p>Compared to Bitcoin’s block size limit which is at one megabyte or ~250K transactions perday, BCash increased that limit to 8MB, which can cater 2 million transactions per day.</p>

<p>In terms of user’s concerned in both Bitcoin and BCash, there is just a very tiny difference on the frontend. In short, BCash delivers more transaction per day compared to Bitcoin and with lower fees compared to the later.</p>

<p>There are some who contradict the presence of BCash for individual reasons and wish to undermine it as a practical other option to Bitcoin. Rather than offering a specialized or monetary scrutinize of BCash these individuals allude to BCash as "bcash" via web-based networking media with the expectation that this moniker will prompt perplexity and reduce reception rates. </p>

<p>In the event that your <a href="/introduction-bitcoin-paper-wallets-cold-storage/">wallet or trade</a> utilizes the expression "bcash" they are likely alluding to BCash; at the same time, it ought to be noticed that "bcash" is not the best possible name, nor a usually utilized truncation of BCash, and is an unfriendly endeavor to confound clients. It is best to continue with alert when managing any individual who might utilize the expression "bcash" rather than the money's real name, BCash.</p>

<h2 id="getting">Getting Started With BCash</h2>

<center><img src="/images/bch-02.jpg" alt="what is BCash"/></center>

<p>Regardless of whether you choose to utilize BCash or not is totally up to you. While Bitcoin at present has a bigger system and supporting framework, many are disheartened by the regularly expanding charges and long exchange times. </p>

<p>BCash offers bring down charges and a more solid rate of exchange than Bitcoin. </p>

<p>As far as improvement, the vast majority of the code for BCash is precisely the same Bitcoin's. This influences creating programming or adjusting existing programming to help Bitcoin to money very basic.</p>

<p>Basically, there is nothing that you need to do to get your BitcoinCash – as long as you officially claim some bitcoins. </p>

<p>Fork made BCash so a large number of <a href="/nigerian-central-bank-warned-bitcoin-users/">bitcoin users</a> should now have a similar measure of BCash tokens as BCash. </p>

<p>For whatever length of time that regardless you approach your private bitcoin keys, you ought to have the capacity to do what you need with your new tokens. </p>

<p>What's more, thanks bitcoin's overhauled replay conventions, there ought to be no hazard in coincidentally spending BitcoinCash rather than bitcoins. </p>

<p>You may choose to give the cash some an opportunity to pick up a solid footing available before you choose to begin exchanging your cash.</p>

<center><img src="/images/bch-09.jpg" alt="what is BCash"/></center>

<h4>Segregating Bitcoins in TREZOR</h4>

<p>TREZOR currently doing some fix on their wallet since they don't have enough time to work on the Bcash code for they only have one week for it. You can just use an online tool in TREZOR to split your BCash and sending it simultaneously to a BCH address.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1</strong> – Visit the beta version of Trezor wallet. You should use Google Chrome to access the wallet; the author was unable to complete the process using Firefox or a clean install thereof.</p>

<p>Make sure that you’re on the beta site: https://beta-wallet.trezor.io</p>

<p>The reason for visiting the beta Trezor wallet is that it enables you to update your <a href="/for-trezor-this-is-what-segregated-witness-means/">Trezor’s firmware</a> to the latest, beta version (1.5.1). Particularly if you haven’t performed this process before, you should study Trezor’s guide to firmware updates.</p>

<p><strong>Step 2</strong> – Be certain you have a backup of your seed phrase and update your firmware. This is done as follows:</p>

<i>disconnect the device</i>
<i>plug it in while holding both device buttons pressed</i>

<p><strong>Step 3</strong> –  Go to the Coin Splitting Tool. Click on “Connect with TREZOR”. Reconnect your device and enter the PIN as usual.</p>

<p><strong>Step 4</strong> – Select the account you want to split BCH from and enter an address to send the BCH to. It is possible to enter the exchange funding address directly in this stage (see below how to get a deposit address for HitBTC).</p>

<h4>Segregating Bitcoins in Electrum</h4>

<p>If you have an Electrum <a href="/video-bitcoin-wallet-encryption/">Bitcoin wallet</a>, we suggest you follow this excellent guide put together by the Electrum developers. In case that any of this doesn’t make complete sense to you, please don’t use this method it’s pretty risky.</p>

<p>Here’s a TL;DR version of it:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Step 1</strong> – Write down all of your Bitcoin addresses that had Bitcoins in them during the fork.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Step 2</strong> – Go to Wallet – Private Keys – Export and write down only the keys that are related to the addresses you’ve found in step 1.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Step 3</strong> – Move all of your Bitcoins to a new Electrum wallet (create a new wallet through file – new/restore). You’re doing this so that if any of the private keys you exported are compromised in some way, your Bitcoins will be in a new address with a different private key.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Step 4</strong> – ON A DIFFERENT COMPUTER install the Electron Cash wallet. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Step 5</strong> – Import your private keys into Electron Cash. Once done you can use your new coins via that wallet.</p></li>
</ul>
<h4>Segregating Coins in Exodus</h4>

<p>The following process was supplied by one of our users and not tested by us. Use it with caution. In any case of uncertainly please contact Exodus support (they are VERY helpful and fast to respond):</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Step 1</strong> – download the latest version of the Exodus desktop wallet from the Exodus website.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Step 2</strong> – Create your account on Hitbtc as already stated in the article and get your BCC address.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Step 3</strong>– Install the Exodus wallet and click on “Help” menu on the left panel. Scroll down to the menu items on the right and click on the menu called “How do I claim my BCash (BCH)”.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Step 4</strong> – Keep your BCC address (that you got from Hitbtc) handy and follow the instructions. It will calculate the amount of BTC that was in the Exodus wallet before 1st August 2017 and ask you the BCC address where you want to transfer the BCC.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Step 5</strong> – Enter the BCC address and transfer. It might take 2-4hrs for the transfer to take place.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>To convert the BCC to BTC and transfer it back to your <a href="/bitcoin-cold-storage/">Exodus wallet</a> and continue following this article.</p>

<h2 id="buy">How To Buy BCash?</h2>

<center><img src="/images/bch-04.jpg" alt="what is BCash"/></center>

<p>Since August first, BCash has turned into a mainstream digital currency that draws in consideration because of its innovative upgrades. Right now, not all trades give the chance to exchange BCash, however CEX.IO enables merchants and speculators to purchase and offer BCash effectively. </p>

<p>Essentially, sign in to CEX.IO, store reserves by means of bank exchange or charge card and you can exchange BCash either from your desktop or versatile application. Plus500 additionally gives dealers the chance to purchase and offer BCash by means of a propelled exchanging stage, low spreads, and quick execution. </p>

<h4>BCash Trading </h4>

<p>For the individuals who are hoping to exploit BCash and different cryptographic forms of money value vacillations, Plus500 give merchants moment access to exchange BCash, Bitcoin, <a href="/video-new-eea-members/">Ethereum</a> and different digital currencies. The procedure is quick and simple with advantageous and propelled exchanging stage (desktop and versatile), low spreads and moment execution. </p>

<p>In the start of August, the Bitcoin business experienced a noteworthy change in what came to be known as the <a href="/video-segwit-vs-btu/">Bitcoin fork</a>. Instead of going into a lot of the specialized stuff included, which has turned out to be a test to even the best of the specialized personality going around, what it basically implied for the dealers was that the bitcoins got separated into two, one of which kept on being called as Bitcoin while the other part was called as the BCash. </p>

{% include page-toc.html %}

<p>This split had caused a great deal of pressure for merchants and the technologists alike on how precisely this split would happen and what might be the effect of this split in the bitcoin showcase, as far as costs, innovation, numbers and so on. </p>

<p>Since the fork is finished, next comes the topic of where and how to purchase the BCash. The least difficult strategy, particularly on the off chance that you had held some bitcoin in your wallet at the season of the split, is that you would have gotten a proportionate measure of Bitcoin trade out your wallet.</p>
 
<p>In the event that this is not the situation, at that point you need to ask for your merchant or trade for the same and get the <a href="/simple-guide-on-how-to-use-the-airbitz-bitcoin-wallet/">BCash into your wallet</a>. A few trades give a proportionate number of BCash while some give marginally less for an assortment of reasons however this is something that you need to elucidate with your trade. </p>

<p>The issue with such free credit of BCash is that you would not have the capacity to effortlessly pull back them up 'til now. A considerable lot of the trades are as yet confronting a great deal of specialized difficulties on the most proficient method to deal with this Bitcoin split and Bitcoin trade out specific and it might even take a while before the trades start to permit this BCash to be pulled back. </p>

<p>However, with the expanding ubiquity of cryptographic forms of money and the engaging quality of BCash, many trades, for example, CEO.IX, Kraken, and Bithumb give great administration keeping in mind the end goal to purchase and offer the new computerized cash. </p>

<h4>BCash Exchanges </h4>

<center><img src="/images/bch-10.jpg" alt="what is BCash"/></center>

<p>The following strategy, in the event that you don't hold BCash, is to go to a trade and get it. A portion of the major Bitcoin trades like CEO.IX, Kraken and Bittrex have just begun exchanging BCash and are seeing surging volumes in them. In this way, that you should simply to visit these trade locales, investigate request and supply and the cost and go and get them. </p>

<p>In spite of the fact that Kraken had started exchanging Bitcoin trade out the most recent couple of days, it is just today that they began tolerating stores and withdrawals in BCash, which is an indication of the developing utilization of this cryptographic money in the current days. </p>

<p>When you have gotten your BCash, either from the trade or by getting it from the trade, you can utilize it any way you need, much the same as how you would <a href="/altcoin-risks/">spend altcoin</a> so far as that is concerned. You could likewise change over it into Bitcoin again and utilize the bitcoins also. It's as straightforward as that. </p>

{% include page-toc.html %}

<p>Yet, there are a couple of things to remember however. The addresses are indistinguishable for both bitcoin and BCash and consequently, on the off chance that you uncover one, it implies that you naturally uncover alternate also and this is very unsafe as far as security and protection.</p>

<p>Additionally, you uncover your open key and not your private key which would, thusly, imply that you are missing out on a particular layer of security that is inbuilt into the cryptographic money industry. </p>

<p>These are only two or three things that you have to remember before you <a href="/bitcoin-paypal-fund-online-casino/">begin utilizing BCash</a>. One of the plans to conquer this issue is move the bitcoin or BCash to a completely new address so you can guarantee the wellbeing and the security of the other part. </p>

<h4>What are the Benefits of BCash contrast with Bitcoin? </h4>

<p>The begin for the BCash advertise has been splendid as it began off with an extensive market top and it likewise began with a substantial sticker price. Because of the split, BCash is never again related in any way with Bitcoin and needs to make due without anyone else. </p>

<p>How it survives will be referred to in the coming days as we sit tight for an ever increasing number of excavators to hop on to the BCash market and start mining. Much the same as some other digital money, it is essential that BCash gets enough preparing influence (hashrate) from the excavators to continue fabricating the <a href="/video-what-is-blockchain-technology/">blockchain</a>, else it will gradually wilt away beyond words.</p> 

<p>It is critical for the BCash industry to manufacture itself a decent biological community around it with the goal that it is ready to keep the individuals who put into it fulfills. Those will be critical parameters for such instruments to succeed. </p>

<p>BCash needs to build up its own market and show itself to appear as something else and more helpful than Bitcoin. Up until now, the get in BCash, in the exchanges showcase, has been moderate yet it is required to get speed and quality in the coming days as an ever increasing number of merchants and financial specialists start to understand that it is staying put. </p>

<p>One of the significant points of interest it as of now has is the way that any individual who possessed Bitcoin on August 1 will consequently get an equivalent number of BCash and with the multiplication of wallets and with trades tolerating them, BCash is probably going to do well. </p>

{% include page-toc.html %}

<p>Another real favorable position of BCash is its bigger square farthest point. This was one of the significant downsides of the Bitcoin market and this was the motivation behind why the supporters of Bitcoin trade needed a split out the primary spot. </p>

<p>Presently, with as far as possible, they would have the capacity to play out a substantially bigger number of exchanges which would cause the BCash to push the following phase of this innovation.</p>

<h2 id="earn">How To Earn BCash</h2>

<center><img src="/images/bch-05.jpg" alt="what is BCash"/></center>

<p>The three most prominent methods for getting free BCash (BCC): </p>

<p>Store your current Bitcoin on paper wallets whereby you approach the private keys. </p>
<p>Store you current Bitcoin in a wallet that has communicated bolster for BCash. </p>
<p>Store your current Bitcoin on a genuine trade that has communicated bolster for BCash. </p>

<p>This will guarantee that, for each Bitcoin you possess (or part thereof), you will be "credited" with precisely the same of BCash. For instance, in the event that you have 2.35 Bitcoin put away in a <a href="/introduction-bitcoin-paper-wallets-cold-storage/">paper wallet</a>, when the fork happens you will then still claim 2.35 Bitcoin BUT will likewise possess 2.35 BCash! </p>

<p>For my situation, the greater part of my current Bitcoin is as of now put away disconnected on paper wallets. I therefore approach the private keys and in this way don't need to do anything here... </p>

<p>I had some Bitcoin put away on my neighborhood trade (Luno) here in South Africa however. I got an email from Kraken advising me that they will be supporting BCash: </p>

<p>Luckily I as of now have a record at Kraken and in this way exchanged my current Bitcoin lying at Luno to Kraken. This will simply lie there until the point that the tidy passes and the fork is authentic. I will then choose on the off chance that I auction the BCash or keep it...</p> 

<p>Along these lines, help yourself out and ensure you get your free BCash... </p>

<p>I observed BCash's site and saw the accompanying <a href="/bitcoin-trading-with-binary-options/">trades and wallets</a> have communicated bolster. So ensure you have your current Bitcoin put away on a paper wallet or one of these wallets or trades to get your BCash:</p>

<h2 id="spend">Where To Spend BCash?</h2>

<center><img src="/images/bch-06.jpg" alt="what is BCash"/></center>

<p>If you had your balance within your Bitcoin wallet which you hold private key, then you should be able to spend your BCash (BCC/BCH) with the private key! Most wallet will be able to backup your private key, mostly in a 12-word mnemonic phrase (BIP39-compatible), or 24-word if you’re using hardware wallet like Trezor, which I recommend.</p>

<h4>Before spending your BCash</h4>

<p>It’s always recommended to move your Bitcoin (BTC) to a completely new wallet address generated from a new seed, not new address derived from same seed (deterministic wallet).</p>

<p>Wait for at least 6 confirmations, theymos suggested in the forum to wait for 30 confirmation for maximum safety, or at least 3 if you can’t wait!</p>

<p>(Assuming the BCash replay protection is fully functional and work as the premise, it wouldn’t have any risk.)</p>

<h2 id="mining">What is BCash Mining?</h2>

<center><img src="/images/bch-07.jpg" alt="what is BCash"/></center>

<p>Anyway, who's mining BCash? What's more, why are they OK with losing cash? </p>

<p>To start, there are right now just a couple of mining operations, the biggest an obscure on-screen character (or pool of on-screen characters) controlling about 90 percent of the hash control on BCash. </p>

{% include page-toc.html %}

<p>Some guess the inspiration driving these diggers is a simply ideological commitment to greater hinders, the reason BCash supporters split from bitcoin in any case. (BCash gloats 8MB squares, rather than 1MB pieces on bitcoin). </p>

<p>Others trust it's more individual, and there's motivation to propose it could be both. </p>

<p>ViaBTC, the main <a href="/video-qa-the-end-of-mining-centralization/">mining pool</a> to empower its diggers to help BCash, has required the designers of bitcoin's most mainstream programming execution, Bitcoin Core, to be let go. Further, Jihan Wu, co-CEO of Bitmain, one of the world's biggest excavators, spends a lot of his day sending images ridiculing the group on a mainstream BCash WeChat string. </p>

<p>The episodic confirmation would propose then that "political" or "ideological" inspirations are likewise coming to assume a part in mining. All things considered, there is dependably a specific impalpable incentive to approving your own contentions. </p>

<p>Others, however, trust there's more affecting everything than just an advanced "I disclosed to you so," and that mineworkers are putting money on BCash's future productivity.</p>

<h2 id="latest">Latest Bitcoin News</h2>

<center><img src="/images/bch-08.jpg" alt="what is BCash"/></center>

<p>What this implies for the Bitcoin arrange is to set up the phase for the development of innovation and furthermore a position that the innovation would remember everybody as it develops. What this split has done is that it has demonstrated the market that the innovation will tune in to the market and its needs and adjust in like manner. </p>

{% include page-toc.html %}

<p>Once the BCash advertise starts to flourish, it will likewise demonstrate that this innovation split does not really mean one is superior to the next or that one needs beyond words influence the other to survive yet rather that both can survive and help in the development of the system and the innovation. </p>

<p>This could likewise bring about lower exchange charges for both bitcoin and BCash which would, thusly, imply that financial specialists and merchants will probably get more bitcoins and BCash. This lessening in charges can be accomplished because of the way that BCash has extended the measure of the system which would imply that there is less blockage now. </p>

<p>Such favorable circumstances are probably going to drive increasingly of Bitcoin's merchants and excavators towards BCash and this would enable this market to flourish, to develop mechanically and furthermore to develop to be a case for different cryptographic forms of money. </p>

<p>The current split marvel will support trust in such instruments which would, thusly, prompt more nations starting to embrace such innovation. </p>

<p>As of now, the Bitcoin showcase has started to demonstrate its endorsement as the request has developed and costs have shot through the $3000 stamp to head towards the $3500 check as of this written work. This demonstrates the <a href="/8-problems-with-bitcoin-to-solve-before-block-size/">Bitcoin organize</a> is alive and flourishing too, which is probably going to enable Bitcoin to money accomplish a similar impact.</p>
