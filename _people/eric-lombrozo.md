## Quotes

On [increasing Bitcoin's block size](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/bitcoin-core-developer-eric-lombrozo-on-misunderstandings-in-block-size-debate-1455817458):

> As far as the block size itself, I don’t think there was much issue with bigger blocks. I don’t think many of the Core developers actually said, ‘No, we should never have bigger blocks.’ I think, for the most part, the idea of having bigger blocks is something that is appealing. We should find a way to have bigger blocks; we all want bigger blocks. But just increasing the blocks by changing a constant in the code presents a lot of very, very serious problems.

On [Satoshi Nakamoto](https://ybitcoin.com/people/eric-lombrozo/):

> Satoshi Nakamoto (Bitcoin’s pseudonymous inventor) deserves serious respect for having solved a major problem with computer networks—namely, how to use decentralized consensus to create a trustless peer-to-peer money transfer system. It is very admirable that he was able to implement the idea and prove it out. That has assured him a place in history.
