Roger Ver, sometimes known as _Bitcoin Jesus_ or controversially [Bitcoin Anti-Christ](https://medium.com/@WhalePanda/roger-ver-from-bitcoin-jesus-to-bitcoin-antichrist-69fc7a17c622), is the owner of Bitcoin.com, and an investor in many of the world's largest Bitcoin companies. He started investing in bitcoins in early 2011 and bought his first bitcoins at around $1.00.

Roger is an ex-convict. He was sentenced to 10 months in federal prison for a felony involving selling explosives on Ebay.

## Bitcoin Foundation

Roger provided 10,000 bitcoins of funding for the Bitcoin Foundation. The initial board of directors included Gavin Andresen, Mark Karpeles, Charlie Shrem, John Matonis, Peter Vessenes.

Mark Karpeles was CEO of MtGox when it failed resulting in the loss of about $500 million of client funds and is currently facing felony criminal fraud charges. Shortly before the failure Roger Ver investigated MtGox and found it worthy of his confidence.

Charlie Shrem founded and ran BitInstant. He later pled guilty in federal court to criminal felony charges and served over a year in a federal penitentiary.

Peter Vessenes was involved with MtGox through CoinLab to handle all US based customers.

Gavin Andresen and John Matonis both supported Craig Wright's claim of being Satoshi Nakamoto even though Wright was never able to provide any cryptographic proof.

## Bitcoin.com

Ver owns the Bitcoin.com domain name. He originally rented out the domain to Chinese Bitcoin exchange OKCoin. After an argument over payments and terms of the agreements, Ver took back control of the site. 

Since then, Ver has updated the Bitcoin.com site to include information on getting started with Bitcoin, a forum and a news section. 

## MemoryDealers

Ver founded MemoryDealers in 1999. The company sells computer hardware, memory, and routers for low prices.
