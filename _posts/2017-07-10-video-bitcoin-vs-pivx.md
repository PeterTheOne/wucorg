<p>The video simple demonstrates the difference between Bitcoin and PIVX in the aspect of transaction speed. It showed that Bitcoin has proof of work and a centralized control only by the few, so it was quite slower. Unlike the latter, PIVX with SwiftX, Proof of Stake and a decentralized community that cares, it was very quick. </p>
