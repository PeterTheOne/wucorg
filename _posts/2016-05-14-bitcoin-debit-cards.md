<p>Although the newest Bitcoin debit card, <a href="https://bitpay.com/visa/">BitPay's VISA card</a> is perhaps the most exciting of the bunch. It is the first Bitcoin debit card that is available to US residents from all 50 states.

<p><h2 id="avoid">Services To Avoid</h2>
<p><b>BitPlastic</b> - was among the first Bitcoin debit cards. However, they do not appear to be innovating much.
<p>Supposedly they are TOR compatible but I get strange error messages whenever I try to use their services. <b>Perhaps I have too much cybersecurity on my computer for them!!</b>
<p>Additionally, many websites may fail to process a card with no-name. And if you lose your card then you have lost your funds so be extra careful!
<p><b>E-Coin/Wirexapp</b> - The signup process was extremely poor and required a phone verification. Then the account did not even function properly. So I am not sure they even offer a legitimate Bitcoin debit card at all. So just steer clear of these guys.
