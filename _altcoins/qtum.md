<p>Qtum is an <a href="/video-what-is-blockchain-technology/">open source Blockchain project</a> that is developed by the Singapore-based Qtum Foundation. Qtum is a hybrid blockchain application platform. Qtum’s core technology combines a fork of bitcoin core, an <a href="/video-survive-on-the-virtual-currency/">Account Abstraction Layer</a> allowing for multiple Virtual Machines including the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and Proof-of-Stake consensus aimed at tackling industry use cases. We believe this will allow <a href="/video-ethereum-and-smart-contracts/">Smart Contracts</a> and <a href="/making-decentralized-economic-policy/">Decentralized Applications</a> to run on a familiar foundation, while offering a robust environment for developers. </p>

<p>The underlying technology uses an “Account Abstract Layer”, which acts as a bridge between the EVM and the Unspent Transaction Output model of Bitcoin Core.  There will be Oracles and Datafeed functionality, allowing developers to create <a href="/video-a-million-killer-apps-part-1/">Smart Contracts</a> built around trusted sources of information.</p>

<p>The Qtum Foundation plans to be the public blockchain for business. Development efforts will allow us to market this platform to var">ious industries, such as: Mobile Telecommunications, Counterfeit Protection, Finance, Industrial Logistics (shipping, warranty, etc), and Manufacturing.</p>

<p>Qtum provides a Turing-complete blockchain stack, able to execute smart contracts and decentralized applications, comparable to the Ethereum blockchain. However, in contrasts to Ethereum, Qtum is built upon Bitcoin’s well-established UTXO transaction model and employs a Proof-of-stake consensus mechanism that is more practical for business adoption. These augmentations have far-reaching implications for the Qtum blockchain.</p>

<p>Furthermore, Qtum aims to establish an array of services, designed to bridge the still existing gap between blockchains and the business world. These include tools and methods to standardize the workflow of <a href="/video-ethereum-all-time-high-price-and-developments/">business smart contract development</a> and a hub of tested and verified smart contract templates, addressing various specialized business use cases.</p>

<h4>Build decentralized applications you can trust</h4>

<p>Combining a modified Bitcoin Core infrastructure with an intercompatible version of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), Qtum merges the reliability of Bitcoin’s unfailing blockchain with the endless possibilities provided by smart contracts. </p>

<p>Designed with <a href="/video-frequency-stability-property-short-film/">stability, modularity and interoperability in mind</a>, Qtum is the foremost toolkit for building <a href="/video-decentralizing-the-internet-maidsafe/">trusted decentralized applications</a>, suited for real-world, business oriented use cases. Its hybrid nature, in combination with a first-of-its-kind PoS consensus protocol, allow Qtum applications to be compatible with major blockchain ecosystems, while providing native support for mobile devices and IoT appliances.</p>

<h4>Smart Contracts that Mean Business</h4>

<p>Qtum makes it easier than ever for established sectors and legacy institutions to interface with blockchain technology.</p>

<p>Create your own tokens, automate supply chain management and engage in self-executing agreements in a standardized environment, verified and tested for stability.</p>

<p><b>SMART CONTRACT LIFECYCLE MANAGEMENT</b></p>

<p>Qtum, in cooperation with its academic partners, develops tools and methods to standardize the workflow for business smart contract development. This includes the formally verifiable translation of human-readable agreements to machine smart contracts, and the error-resilient specification of their elements, terms and conditions.</p>

<p><b>SETTING INDUSTRY STANDARDS</b></p>

<p>Cooperating with a series of partners and third parties, Qtum aims to establish a smart contract hub, offering secure and thoroughly tested contract templates, tailor fitted for a multitude of industries and use cases, such as supply chain management, telecommunicatios, IoT, social networking, and many more.</p>

<h4>Go Mobile</h4>

<p>Building on <a href="/prestashop-bitcoin-module-merchant-by-spectrocoin/">Bitcoin’s UTXO model</a>, the simple payment verification (SPV) protocol is supported by the Qtum codebase by default. As a result, it is now possible to execute smart contracts from lite wallets, which can be easily installed on any given mobile device, heralding an age of mobile decentralized applications. </p>

<p>With this, the blockchain is finally ready to take up disruption in a world in which half of all internet traffic is being generated by smartphones and tablets.</p>

<h4>Account Abstraction Layer</h4>

<p>Qtum extends Bitcoins 'Script' language so that it functions as a vehicle to transport code to Qtum’s version of the EVM. With this, it is now possible to execute smart contracts and run decentralized applications, simply and securely, in environments that were previously out of reach for <a href="/blockchain-explained-for-normal-people/">turing-complete blockchains</a>, combining the endless possibilities provided by smart contracts with the stability and maturity of the bitcoin ecosystem.</p>

<h4>Cross Platform and Backward Compatibility</h4>

<p>Qtum is compatible with existing Ethereum contracts as well as Bitcoin gateways, and will maintain backward-compatibility even if the system is updated.</p>

<h2 id="earn">How To Earn Qtum?</h2>

<p>The Qtum project offers many advantages to the Smart Contract development community. This project is designed to implement the best parts of the Bitcoin and Ethereum projects, into a business-friendly blockchain. </p>

<p>By implementing the Bitcoin Improvement Protocols, and making use of the <a href="/video-will-ethereum-pass-bitcoin/">Ethereum Virtual Machine</a>, <a href="/video-digital-currency-mainstream/">digital currency</a> enthusiasts can finally agree on one platform that will offer stability and direction.</p>

<p>The account model is similar to a bank account. Each party has a balance and can subtract a portion of their balance to increase the balance of another party in order to send money. This model is conceptually very simple to understand. </p>
{% include page-toc.html %}
<p>However, to make this work in a blockchain environment many pieces of logic must be added to avoid “double spending”, spending the same funds twice. This logic makes the account model less simple internally, and adds a number of restrictions.</p>

<p>The UTXO model on the other hand is similar to having an ecosystem built on bank checks (without an actual bank account, the check itself is the money). There is a “pay to” field which in our example provides instructions to how the money must be spent, and each check has an amount. You can not go to cash the check and say “cash half the check and give me half back”. </p>

<p>Your “balance” per-se is the sum of the checks which you are capable of spending. This model is more difficult to explain, but because every token is either “spent” or “unspent” and there is no in-between, it is much easier to secure in a blockchain environment with less logic required to maintain that security.</p>

<p>Each model has it’s own pros and cons. Accounts are conceptually simpler and thus smart contracts written on an account system tend to be much clearer and easy to understand. With UTXOs however it is simpler to validate a transaction, which can be done simply by verifying that the transaction has been confirmed by the blockchain, in the case of the SPV protocol.</p>

<p>The UTXO model also has been tested and proven to be secure by Bitcoin, which has operated for over 7 years with no significant changes to its core model. It has also been proven to be more scalable, and transactions can easily be processed in parallel (which can be more difficult in the account model).</p>

<p>With all of this in mind, we at Qtum felt that building on the UTXO model best aligned with our goals and that adding the <a href="/bitcoin-hardware-wallet-ledger-nano/">Account Abstraction Layer</a> brought us the best of both worlds. Now we gain all of the security and interoperability benefits of the UTXO model, while smart contracts are written as if they were based on the conceptually simpler account model.</p>
