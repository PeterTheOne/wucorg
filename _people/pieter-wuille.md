Peter Wuille is a [Bitcoin Core](/bitcoin-core/) developer and the co-founder of Blockstream. He is #2 in terms of commits to Bitcoin Core and is responsible for important improvements to Bitcoin like [BIP 66](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0066.mediawiki), [libsecp256k1](https://github.com/bitcoin/secp256k1), and [Segregated Witness](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0141.mediawiki).

## Bitcoin Core

Wuille discovered Bitcoin in 2010 and has been a Bitcoin Core developer since May 2011. In 2012, Wuille published [BIP 32](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki), which added  hierarchical deterministic wallets to Bitcoin.

Segregated Witness is Wuille's latest contribution, and is currently live on testnet. Full network activation is expected in April 2016.

## Blockstream

Blockstream builds open source software and infrastructure for Bitcoin, including the lightning network and sidechains. Wuille co-founded the company in 2014 and currently serves as a core-tech engineer. Blockstream has raised [over $65 million in venture capital](/en/venture-capital-investments-in-bitcoin-and-blockchain-companies/).

## Segregated Witness

Wuille's [Segregated Witness](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0141.mediawiki) was introduced at Scaling Bitcoin Hong Kong 2015. SegWit improves the Bitcoin protocol by decreasing the amount of data used by each transaction, which effectively increases transaction capacity without the need for a hard fork.

Early Bitcoin investor [Trace Mayer](/trace-mayer-bitcoin-expert/) called SegWit "a tremendous innovation".
