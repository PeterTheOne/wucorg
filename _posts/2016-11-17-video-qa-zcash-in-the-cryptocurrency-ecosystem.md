<p>I downloaded and ran the testnet version, and did some test transactions. I read the implementation of zkSNARKs and understood 30% of it, apparently that's generous. From a scaling perspective, Zcash has significantly bigger challenges than <a href="/re-invention-of-the-global-supply-chain-through-blockchain/">Bitcoin or Ethereum</a>, but it works very well collaboratively with other chains. </p>

<p>I would love to see Zcash as a sidechain in the ecosystem, where features are borrowed and used temporarily from each system. From Zcash you can get a better degree of privacy and anonymity, then move it out into something else. We all benefit from these inventions.</p>
