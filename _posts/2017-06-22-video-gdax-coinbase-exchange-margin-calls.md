<p>Ethereum network has been having transaction issues as of recently. The Ether/USD trading pair on Coinbase crashed to $13 an ether temporarily. The site has suspended Ethereum activity and has gone down temporarily to fix their problems. It’s not the only exchange having issues, in fact the whole Ethereum network hasn’t been working properly since the Status.im ICO yesterday.</p>
