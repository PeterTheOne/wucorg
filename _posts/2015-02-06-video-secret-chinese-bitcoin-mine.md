<p>In October of last year Motherboard gained access to a massive, <a href="/we-use-coins-bitcoin-mining-guide/">secretive Bitcoin mine</a> housed within a repurposed factory in the Liaoning Province in rural northeast China. </p>

<p>This is the infrastructure that keeps the digital currencyâ€™s decentralized network up and running, and its operators are profiting big time. </p>

<p>The mine we visited is just one of six sites owned by a secretive group of four people, part of a colossal mining operation that, as of our visit, cumulatively generated 4,050 bitcoins a month, equivalent to a monthly gross of $1.5 million.</p>
