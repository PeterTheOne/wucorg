<p>The altcoin constellation: Ripple, Litecoin, Ethereum, <a href="/video-more-than-just-money/">Ethereum Classic</a>, Dashcoin, Monero coin, Zerocash . Crytocurrencies should not be treated as investments unless you are very experienced, since they are high-risk assets. ShapeShift, a blockchain asset exchange between currency pairs, allowing all the alternative currencies to be liquid and fungible with each other. Bitcoin shouldn't be the only chain that exists but it will probably be the dominant chain with 60-80% of the market share.</p>
