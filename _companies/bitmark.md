<a href="https://bitmark.com">Bitmark's</a> mission is to promote a healthy digital environment by enabling property rights and provenance for digital assets. As a cleantech for the internet and the Internet of Things, we enable a transparent and unforgeable chain of ownership and attribution for digital assets that can be authenticated by anyone.

Bitmark allows you to turn your personal data and digital assets into unique property.

In a healthy digital environment we know what is what, who is who, and what belongs to whom. But we are swimming in an ocean of digital detritus where weâ€™ve contributed data from personal devices and on computers, as well as data from the expanding Internet of Things. Though we may not see our data, parts of us are forever in the internet. Those parts like our words, our images and media have value for others yet we have no regard for them, our rightful properties.

Bitmark is one of the steps towards the healthy digital environment of the future by enabling ownership of every type of digital data, be it digital art, personal health or location data, or a digital trust of your digital wealth. Prior to Bitmark, we have had no way to individually identify digital files, mark them as one-of-a-kind, and to ensure their ownership. With our peer-to-peer property system built on the open-source Bitmark blockchain we enable the issuance and transfer of property titles for digital assets, for which the chain of ownership and attribution can be authenticated by anyone.

Property is empowering. Property is privacy: your home, your car, your stuff, your data.
