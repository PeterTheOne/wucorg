<p>Needham & Company LLC on Thursday released a note for investors which entitled ‘Economic and Financial Turmoil Driving Bitcoin Interest & Adoption’. The note actually tackles about variety of signs and indicators that would push forward the increase of bitcoin adoption, namely capital controls, demonetization, hyperinflation as well as bitcoin bans.
<p>On first stages, some factors do have negative effect but Needham considered the possibility that they will ultimately drive <a href="/rich-famous-bitcoin/">bitcoin interest</a> and adoption in the long run.</p>

<p>The company acted as lead or co-manager in over 785 public offerings which made them a nationally recognized investment banking and asset management firm focused solely on growth companies and <a href="/confidential-transactions/">confidential transactions</a>.</p>

<h3 id="banning">Banning Bitcoin Does Not Produce Results</h3>

<p>Needham analyst and author Spencer Bogart explained that some countries will inevitably ban or place onerous regulation on Bitcoin.</p>

<p>“While these actions certainly don’t benefit Bitcoin adoption, they typically don’t prevent it either,” he noted, adding that:</p>

<blockquote>"While some countries have either banned bitcoin or enacted prohibitive regulations, we note that the results appear to be the opposite of the intended effect: interest in bitcoin has skyrocketed in some countries that have banned bitcoin."</blockquote>

<p>In his example, he cited Bangladesh particularly the Central Bank’s bitcoin ban in September 2014 which imposed 12 years of jail time for offenders. He iterated in 2016, due to consequently using bitcoin’s share of internet search queries as a proxy for interest in bitcoin, country Bangladesh map became number seven globally with the highest bitcoin interest.</p>

<p>“Interestingly, the top rising related topics and queries all appear geared toward genuine usage (searches for popular wallets, conversion rates, etc) as opposed to activity related to scams/Ponzi schemes or regulatory news,” he added.</p>

<p>Similarly, Bolivia also saw an impale in bitcoin interest and ranks number eight overall for relevant search terms which banned bitcoin in mid-2014.</p>

<p>The tremendous response Bogart describes on those countries where bitcoin has been outlawed is actually well explain by the Streisand effect, which states that censorship often has unintended consequences, and those who are censored from information will be likely to seek it out even more vigorously than before on <a href="/why-use-bitcoin/">using bitcoin</a>.</p>

<h3 id="lead">Some Other Reasons That May Lead To Bitcoin Adoption</h3>

<p>Among those reasons that may lead to bitcoin adoption discussed  in the note are capital controls, demonetization, and hyperinflation across several countries which Bogart claimed are  India propelling bitcoin’s rising interest and adoption worldwide.</p>

<p>Bogart explained that an example for that is India which banned large bills last November and bitcoin’s interest, based on internet search volume and well as trading volume, surged and bitcoin usage has tripled since the ban.</p>

<p>In Nigeria, the rate of inflation has nearly doubled over the past year to 19% which is accompanied by “a rapid increase in search interest for Bitcoin within the country,” he said, adding that in Venezuela the hyperinflation (180%+) problem has been plaguing the economy and it is “driving a surge in Bitcoin interest and trading volume.” Overall, he concluded that:</p>

<blockquote>"Driving global interest in bitcoin is also because of interference in the storage and flow of capital is driving global interest in bitcoin."</blockquote>

<h3 id="switzerland">Bitcoin Adoption In Switzerland</h3>

<p>Switzerland is one of those countries that have embraced <a href="/bitcoin-trading/">bitcoin trading</a>  while some countries have opted to ban it. They have already added the ability to buy bitcoin at any of the National Swiss Railway ticket kiosks, of which there are over a switzerlandthousand spread around the country. Paying utilities with bitcoin is also possible in the Swiss town Zug. Hence, the country is also reportedly developing a potential licensing of “crypto-banks” which would “create a new category of financial institutions that are able to handle cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin,” Bogart described.</p>

<p>According to the note, United States followed 20 other countries in bitcoin interest as revealed by bitcoin’s share of internet search queries. “While much of the initial venture activity and interest in bitcoin came from within the United States, international interest has surged,” the note reads. Caracas (Venezuela), Kuala Lumpur (Malaysia), Sandton (South Africa), and Lagos (Nigeria) all exceed the interest from San Francisco and New York, the note revealed.</p>
