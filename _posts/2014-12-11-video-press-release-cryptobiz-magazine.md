<p>I'm Jay Addison for Investmentpitch media and Crypto Biz Magazine, today we are featuring HTML5 coin at HTMLCoin.com. HTML5 coin is an online currency that inherited it's payment encryption technology from Bitcoin. It is designed to deliver faster transactions and eliminate the need for miners to generate transactions like Bitcoin. A Mobile wallet is currently being developed to make HTML5 coin more user friendly. This will also make buying and selling goods and services, and tipping through social media a simple process</p>
