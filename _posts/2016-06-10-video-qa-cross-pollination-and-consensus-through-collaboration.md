Cross-pollination/ cross-genetic lines or horizontal transfer of DNA between species vs. the open source environment. Different <a href="/video-bitcoin-101-what-happens-when-we-decentralize-money/">cryptocurrency developers</a> exchanging code ("DNA blueprints") and adopting it. Bitcoin is rapidly progressing. Concepts of basic income. </p>
