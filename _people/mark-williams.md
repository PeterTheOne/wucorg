## Controversy

On December 17, 2013, shortly after Bitcoin's run up to $1,200, Williams [published](http://www.businessinsider.com/williams-bitcoin-meltdown-10-2013-12) an op-ed on Business Insider. Among other analysis, Williams predicted that one Bitcoin would be worth $10 or less by July-2014: 

> I predict that Bitcoin will trade for under $10 a share by the first half of 2014, single digit pricing reflecting its option value as a pure commodity play.  Miners/speculators will be best served to acknowledge the meltdown has begun, act quickly and take fleeting profit off the table. 

At the time of his prediction, one Bitcoin was worth $610. 

Bitcoin's price never dropped close to William's prediction of $10 at anytime during 2014. On July 1, 2014, one Bitcoin was valued at $635.59. 

Six months earlier, a reddit user called Williams "Professor Bitcorn". His incorrect prediction and [other attacks](http://insidebitcoins.com/news/opinion-professor-bitcorn-strikes-again/26267) on Bitcoin have caused the nickname to stick.
