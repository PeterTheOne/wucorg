<p>So I've gotten into <a href="/video-why-bitcoin-matters-mauldin-economics/">Bitcoin</a> recently, and decided to write a song about it! Not meant to offend or annoy anyone - just a bit of fun! Thank you to Meghan Trainor's "All About That Bass" for the melodic inspiration, and thank you to my cameraman & editor extraordinaire, Kevin Lepsoe.</p>

<h2>TRANSCRIPT</h2>

Lyrics :

Yeah, it's pretty clear, Bitcoin is risin’ up 
Vir-tu-al curr-en-cies 
Governments can’t make ‘em stop 
Cause it’s got that freedom that all of us love
Peer-to-peer payments, we can’t get enough

It’s Money 2.0; cold storage vaults we trust
Effort-less trans-ac-tions 
Are just another plus+++
If you are hashing, hashing, move the Blockchain up 
We’re in a paradigm shift so get yourself a Wallet

Yeah, it’s transforming the basic pillars of society
And it’s the predominant peer-to-peer crypto currency 
Bitcoin is a “technological tour de force” (Bill Gates)
So we should all really just go a-head and jump up on board 

Because you know 
I'm all about that Bit (coin)
'Bout that Bit (coin), keep mining
I'm all about that Bit (coin)
'Bout that Bit (coin), keep mining
I'm all about that Bit (coin)
'Bout that Bit (coin), keep mining
I'm all about that Bit (coin)
'Bout that Bit - Bit - Bit - Bit (coin)

Give me some Satoshiiiiiiii 
Go ‘head, you know it means a lot to me 
Please, no more faucets - everyone agrees! 
I'm here to tell ya
Bitcoin’s faster, more secure and 
more efficient than others

Yeah, my mama used Bitcoin to pay for my College fees 
And yesterday I used it to buy myself some coffee
You can use it everywhere, everyday and any place
…and one day we’ll even use it to fly into space!

Because you know 
I'm all about that Bit (coin)
'Bout that Bit (coin), keep mining
I'm all about that Bit (coin)
'Bout that Bit (coin), keep mining
I'm all about that Bit (coin)
'Bout that Bit (coin), keep mining
I'm all about that Bit (coin)
'Bout that Bit - Bit - Bit - Bit (coin)
