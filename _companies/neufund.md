<a href="https://neufund.org/">NEUFUND</a> is building a blockchain-based and investor-directed platform which bridges the worlds of blockchain and venture capital. Our tech & legal platform enables the creation and operation of a new kind of VC fund. One that unlocks the resources of cryptocurrency and blockchain to fund startups and all forms of technological innovation and disruption.

## Evolution

While initially our platform is going to be utilised exclusively by our fund, that will only act as the seed of what we hope to grow to be the largest investment ecosystem on the blockchain.

Neufund will gradually expand its platform’s capabilites and with that open up the platform to startups and funds of all sizes, industries and jurisdictions to take part to a truly open investment ecosystem.

Our platform will enable investors to access a diverse dealflow while keeping their investments fully liquid. At the same time startups and funds can now reach previously unreachable sources of capital and through our platform take advantage of what blockchain technology has to offer. Unparalleled velocity of fundraising, efficiency and security through smart contracts and novel governance models are only some of the capabilities that blockchain technology can unlock.

## Technology

NEUFUND is an ecosystem of smart contracts operating on the Ethereum blockchain. The blockchain-based platform creates a new type of ownership that is neither money nor stock, but crypto tokens which represent equity and at the same time are as liquid as a currency. Such tokens have an intrinsic value to the network, but at the same time they also represent value of the business operating in the real – off-chain – world.

Using blockchain and smart contracts allows NEUFUND to increase the speed of capital flow, diversify tech innovation funding and reduce transaction costs for investing.
