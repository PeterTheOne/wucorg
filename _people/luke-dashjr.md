Luke Dashjr, known in the Bitcoin world as Luke-Jr, is a [Bitcoin Core](/bitcoin-core/) developer and the founder of Eligis mining pool. He has made over [200 contributions](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commits?author=luke-jr) to Bitcoin Core, and maintains the [Bitcoin Improvement Proposals](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0001.mediawiki#what-is-a-bip) section on GitHub.

## Bitcoin Core

Dashjr has been contributing to Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin since 2011.

[Segregated Witness](/what-are-segwit-benefits/), a proposal that among other improvements increases Bitcoin's transaction capacity, was implemented as a soft-work [with Dashjr’s help](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0141.mediawiki#credits).

## BFGMiner

[Released in 2014](https://bitcointalk.org/?topic=877081) , Dashjr’s [BFG Miner](https://bitcointalk.org/?topic=877081) has become one of the most widely used implementations of [Bitcoin mining software](https://www.bitcoinmining.com/bitcoin-mining-software/). It supports a wide range of mining hardware and is available on Mac, Windows, and Linux.

## Eligius Mining Pool

Dashjr founded [Eligius](http://eligius.st/~gateway/), one of the first Bitcoin mining pools. Today it amounts to less than 1% of the Bitcoin network hashrate. Eligius is an anonymous mining pool and no registration is required.

## BIPs 22 & 23

Dashjr is responsible for BIPs [22](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0022.mediawiki) and [23](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0023.mediawiki).

BIP 22 added protocol support for long polling, which allowed to be notified of new templates immediately. BIP 23 [allows miners](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=957509.0) to "check the basic validity of their next block before expending work on it, reducing risks of accidental
hardforks or mining invalid blocks."
