PEY's commitment to dividend stability“employs one of the segment's most robust dividend viability screens” makes it an attractive option in the dividend-seeking space. PEY employs one of the segment's most robust dividend viability screens, only including firms with 10 straight years of dividend increases. The 50 highest-yielding firms above $2 billion in market cap that fit this bill are then weighted by dividend yield. 

The resulting portfolio tilts much smaller than our benchmark with elevated market risk and a large overweight to the utilities sector, but delivers solid yield. PEY enjoys strong liquidity, with hundreds of thousands of shares trading daily at tight spreads. Its basket of US large- and midcaps also makes for easy creation/redemption. PEY is on the pricey side in terms of fees, but tracking is tight and it has a history of efficiency and reliable yield to point to. Overall, it's a strong option in the space.
