<p>A vulnerability in the Jaxx Bitcoin/Ethereum wallet leads to 400,000 worth of stolen funds.</p>

<p>Dubai International airport wants to use digital passports utilizing Blockchain technology and Localbitcoins introduces a new fee structure to their Bitcoin exchanging platform.</p>

<p>So far it's known that $400,000 was stolen in btc, ether, etc, and zcash. It apparently affected the desktop version of Jaxx wallet only.</p>

<p>Next, Dubai is taken a step towards developing its new “10x policy”, attempting to digitize its public sector ensuring that public services are 10 years ahead of the rest of the world.</p>

<p>Localbitcoins is saying on average the Bitcoin fees will be lower than they used to be. I believe it’s more of a fair structure to spread the fees evenly between both buyers and sellers.</p>
