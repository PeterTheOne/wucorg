## Quotes

On [Bitcoin's design](http://coinjournal.net/mits-cory-fields-contentiousness-in-bitcoin-is-sign-of-good-health/):

> If the fighting stops, if it becomes easy to push through a hard-fork, a difficult change, a major change, then at that point we know we have lost and it’s not an interesting system anymore. If it’s that easy to manipulate, then it’s not worth working on this.
