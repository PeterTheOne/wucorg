<img src="/images/trace-mayer.png" alt="Trace Mayer" align="right"> Entrepreneur, investor and early Bitcoin thought-leader Trace Mayer sat down with Money & Tech's Jered Kenna to talk about all things <a href="/video-future-digital-currency-documentary/">Bitcoin and digital currency</a>, from predictions around the current arrests and regulation conversations, to the benefits of Bitcoin as "the first practical implementation of triple-entry bookkeeping," and the immense possibility of the higher-level decentralized distributed ledger concept, to -ultimately- why it's so important to hold onto your own <a href="/bitcoin-private-keys-entropy/">private keys</a>.

As Trace Mayer puts it, innovating on the old saying "He who has the gold makes the rules," it's increasingly becoming "He who holds the private keys makes the rules."
