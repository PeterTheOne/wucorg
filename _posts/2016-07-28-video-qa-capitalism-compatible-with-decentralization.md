<p>Bitcoin is described as a "hyper-capitalist" system. Is capitalism compatible with decentralization? Capitalism is a way of organizing the pyramid. Distinguish between "capitalism" and "free-market." <a href="/genesis-mining-review/">Bitcoin represents free markets</a> at a level that has not been done before. Old labels don't apply. Don't try to decide who goes the top -- remove the pyramid. Network-centric systems of organisation that are flat, change the political spectrum and labels like "capitalism." I'm a disruptarian: once it gets corrupted, start again. Decentralised networks give us a recipe for continuously disrupting the accumulation of power.</p>
