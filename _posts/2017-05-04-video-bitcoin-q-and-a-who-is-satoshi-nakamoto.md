<p>"Satoshi Nakamoto" is the pseudonym used by the person(s) who created Bitcoin. We do not know who they are, whether they are still alive, whether it was more than one person, whether they were a 'good person' or a 'bad person.' Geometric proofs and Euclid's identity. You know parallel lines don't intersect in a three-dimensional space because when you studied the proofs in school, you started from certain axioms, and if they were violated there was an absurd outcome. </p>

<p>The axioms hold true not because Euclid told us they do, but because we have independently verified their truth. Bitcoin works not because Satoshi Nakamoto said so, but because we have independently verified the operations underpinning it and continue to use it ourselves. It does not matter who Satoshi is, any more than it matters who Euclid is.</p>
