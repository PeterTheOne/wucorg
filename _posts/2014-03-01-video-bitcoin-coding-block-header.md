<p>Most people on earth have never even heard of Merkle roots. But bitcoin programmers deal with them every day. This is old school technology in terms of software, but still very important in terms of <a href="/news/#security">security and data management</a>. In this video James will walk you into the world of Merkle roots and Ralph Merkle, who invented this technology in the late 1980s. If you like seeing actual coding examples, your in luck. James starts incorporating actual python examples...after all, would you want to listen to Car Talk and not want to hear about a muffler?</p>
