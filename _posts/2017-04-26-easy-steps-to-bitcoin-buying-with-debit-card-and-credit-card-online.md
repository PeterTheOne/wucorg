<br/><br/>
Payments via credit card are reversible. In fact, merchants can’t receive yet the money from payments via credit card until sixty (60) days after the card has been swiped.
 <br/><br/>
Since the Bitcoin transactions are not reversible, bitcoin selling using CC for payment is risky for merchants. Now, companies discovered new ways to avoid fraud and that fortunately lead to much easier purchase with a CC, as seen by a lot of options that is listed below.
<br/><br/>

Bitcoin exchanges have been having issues with regards to being constantly attack so it is obvious they have the most secure protection and best security against personal info hacking. 
<br/><br/>
A risk is always present in everything with regards to having information online. Even Yahoo before was hacked and the information of those 400 million accounts were all stolen.
<br/><br/>
<strong>10.	Where should I let my bitcoin be after buying?</strong>
<br/><br/>
We highly suggest keeping bitcoin you opt to keep safe in your own wallet. There are several Bitcoin exchanges that have been hacked losing all the customer’s funds. In order to avoid being a victim of them, storing your bitcoin in your personal wallet where you can control it is the easiest way. 
<br/><br/>
