<p>Satoshi Nakamoto is the name used by the unknown person or persons who designed bitcoin and created its original reference implementation. As a part of the implementation, they also devised the first blockchain database. In the process they were the first to solve the double spending problem for digital currency. They were active in the development of bitcoin up until December 2010.</p>

<p>Nakamoto has claimed to be a man living in Japan, born on 5 April 1975. However, speculation about the true identity of Nakamoto has mostly focused on a number of cryptography and computer science experts of non-Japanese descent, living in the United States and Europe.</p>

<p>One person, Australian programmer Craig Steven Wright, has claimed to be Nakamoto, though he has not yet offered proof of this. As of 2 February 2017, Nakamoto is believed to own up to roughly one million bitcoins, with a value estimated at over US$1.6 billion.</p>
