<h2>TRANSCRIPT</h2>

Steemit addresses the difficulties of growing a new social media network and a new crypto currency by combining them together. 

Steemit incentivizes the user base by paying the writers and voters in the steem/steem power/steem backed dollar crypto currency.

For those of us who are already familiar with cryptos this is pretty much a no brainer. 

Because Steemit is a social network, it makes learning about crypto much less overwhelming for those who have no previous knowledge about crypto. 

You don’t have to be a member to be able to read the content on the website.

If you’d like to become a member, there is no sign up fee, or any kind of cost what so ever to be made on your part.

You can learn about virtually anything on this platform already, not just about crypto, but for the sake of keeping this video focused, I’ll stick to the crypto field. 

By simply reading all of the many, many blogs written on Steemit that feature cryptos, you can learn all sorts of things like: what steemit is and how it’s evolved over it’s relatively short time of being in existence, or you can learn about other crypto coins, or other technological developments being made in the crypto world. 

Steemit is also particularly great for newbies to learn about crypto because you can use the comment section below each blog post to converse directly with other users and ask any questions you might have.
