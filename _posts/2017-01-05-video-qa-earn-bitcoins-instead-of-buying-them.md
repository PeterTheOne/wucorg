<h2>TRANSCRIPT</h2>

I don't buy bitcoins, I earn bitcoins. There is a <a href="/bitcoin-legal-issues/">fundamental philosophical difference</a> when you earn bitcoins, or any currency in the digital domain, through the fruit of your labour instead of buying them. When you sell your labour for bitcoin, you are adding your productivity to Bitcoin and removing it from fiat currencies, from the traditional sphere of economics. I encourage you, whatever you do, to do it for bitcoins. It will take time but eventually someone will pay you in bitcoin; these things take momentum and it is increasing.
