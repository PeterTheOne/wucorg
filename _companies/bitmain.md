## Hashnest

Hashnest is a unique cloud mining service: it hosts the mining hardware owned by its customers. This setup eliminates the need for customers to host mining hardware at their own homes or warehouses. Hashnest makes it possible to mine bitcoins without worrying about noise, electricity costs, or excess heat. 

The hash power generated by Hashnest is pointed towards Antpool.
