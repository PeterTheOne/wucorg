[Ledger](http://geni.us/ledger) is a Bitcoin security company known for its Bitcoin hardware wallets.

## Products

Ledger currently offers three Bitcoin hardware wallets: the Ledger Nano, Ledger HW.1, and Ledger Unplugged.

### Ledger Nano

The [Ledger Nano](https://www.weusecoins.com/bitcoin-ledger-wallet-review/) is Ledger's flagship hardware wallet, built with a CC EAL5+ smartcard. The Nano stores and creates Bitcoin private keys offline in the smartcard's secure environment. The device plugs into the USB port of any computer and can be used with Android phones via an OTG cable.  

### Ledger HW.1

The Ledger HW.1 is similar to the Ledger Nano and built upon the same CC EAL5+ smartcard. The HW.1, however, lacks the Nano's sleek design and metal build. Ledger calls the HW.1 an "enterprise solution for multi-signature". It is a cheap, secure way for companies or groups to securely share control of bitcoins.

### Ledger Unplugged

The Ledger Unplugged is a Java Card, NFC Bitcoin wallet. It provides extra security for mobile wallets. The Unplugged is compatible with Android phones using Mycelium or GreenAddress.

## Applications

### Chrome Extension

The [Ledger Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ledger-wallet/kkdpmhnladdopljabkgpacgpliggeeaf) is used to setup the Ledger Nano and HW.1. Once setup, the Chrome Extension serves as a software wallet and is used to send and receive bitcoins with either wallet.

### Android & iPhone Apps

The [Ledger](http://geni.us/ledger) [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.ledger.wallet) and [iPhone](https://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=960196441&mt=8) apps are used to provide 2-factor authentication for outgoing transactions. While each Ledger device comes with its own 2-factor security card, the iPhone and Android apps can also be used as a more convenient form of 2-factor authentication.

## Future Plans

Ledger plans to release its fourth device, the Ledger Blue, in mid-2016.
