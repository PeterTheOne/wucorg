<h2>Thinking About Playing in a Real Bitcoin Casino? Here are Some How to Use Bitcoins Tips</h2>

<p>Yes, it’s a simple as that. You just have to do some little reading regarding the use of bitcoins.</p>

<h2>Basically, you just have to remember these three steps:</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Get a bitcoin wallet.</p></li>
<li><p>Get bitcoins.</p></li>
<li><p>Enjoy playing in some of the best casinos in the world with 100% anonymity.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The most important step is getting a bitcoin wallet. There are three different kinds of <a href="/how-bitcoin-unlimited-users-may-end-up-on-different-blockchains/">bitcoin wallets</a>: online wallets, software (offline wallets), and hardware wallets. You can choose a wallet from this: bitcoin.org. </p>

<p>Hardware wallets are the most secure but online wallets are arguably the easiest to use. You should be fine choosing an online wallet. It’s not really difficult using whatever wallet. You just have to read the instructions and figure out how the interface works.</p>

<p>When it comes to getting bitcoins, you can ask from friends to transfer bitcoins to you or you can buy them using standard money. bitcoincasinos.reviews is a good starting point for obtaining bitcoins. </p>


<p>You can actually sign up for a casino bitcoin without obtaining bitcoins first. Many of the best bitcoin casino sites at present provide instructions on how you can obtain bitcoins so you can start with an empty bitcoin wallet. What’s important is that you have a bitcoin wallet.</p>

<h2>Bitcoins in an Online Casino</h2>

<p>Using bitcoins in a bitcoin casino is all about depositing bitcoins and withdrawing them. Once you have signed up for an account, you can then proceed to the page where you can deposit your bitcoins. It is also in this page, usually, where you can withdraw your bitcoin winnings. </p>

<p>Some sites call it the “Cashier” page while others provide direct links for the “Deposit,” “Withdraw,” and “Get Bitcoins” functions. It’s impossible for you not to quickly figure out how the use of bitcoins works in online bitcoin gambling sites. If you know the rules of various online casino games, you shouldn’t find it hard learning how to use bitcoins for BTC gambling.</p>

<p>Just be reminded that online casinos that use bitcoins have varying terms and conditions. It is very important to read these terms and conditions so you wouldn’t be surprised that, for instance, you suddenly lost the bonus bitcoins you have earned because it expired.</p>

<p>In our BTC casinos reviews, we see to it that we point out important details about the terms and conditions of the <a href="/for-trezor-this-is-what-segregated-witness-means/">online bitcoin casinos</a> we are reviewing. We highlight the terms we find questionable or unusual. We help our readers decide whether or not a site is secure or reliable.</p>

<h2>Are Bitcoin Casinos Better than Standard Online Casinos?</h2>

<p>Bitcoin may have had its share of challenges and controversies but it has slowly become a good alternative to traditional currency. Many have already started accepting and paying in bitcoins in lieu of traditional money. Bitcoins are particularly advantageous in the field of online gambling as they make it easier to wager and collect winnings.</p>

<p>Typically, gambling sites or online casinos require credit cards or some form of online payment facility to allow players to place their bets and receive the amount they have won. However, not everyone has a credit card. Online payment facilities, on the other hand, require credit cards to become verified and to transfer funds. </p>

<p>As such, not many get to enjoy the fun of being able to play casino games through the Internet. There are sites that offer alternative methods for online payments but they are usually unreliable and far from secure. Bitcoin addresses the security and regulatory concerns associated with other forms of currencies or payment schemes employed by standard online casinos.</p>

<p>It would be inexpedient pitting bitcoin online casinos against traditional casinos. As of now, they have their respective advantages and disadvantages that only tend to cancel each other out. Besides, some of the best bitcoin casinos around are casinos that used to only transact using standard currency. </p>

<p>The better thing to do would be to just enumerate the many advantages of online casinos that accept bitcoins. These advantages are too compelling that you may just decide to start playing using bitcoins soon enough.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>For one, online casinos that use bitcoins don’t involve fees when transferring and withdrawing funds. When using credit cards or other modes of online payment, you would usually have to pay some fee which accumulate to a large amount over time.</p></li>

<li><p>Bitcoin casinos tend to have more secure transactions. Bitcoins are used in the same way regardless of where they are used. Cryptocurrency transactions are just inherently secure. It’s just up to the users to properly secure their bitcoin wallets.</p></li>

<li><p>The use of bitcoins does not involve third parties and their comissions (just like Bitcoin’s creator Satoshi Nakamoto had planned. As such, transactions tend to be faster. Withdrawals can be completed at the shortest possible time unless the online casino really intends to make it a slow and complicated process (something we will sure take note of in our reviews).</p></li>

<li><p>Moreover, you can expect confidentiality when you play at bitcoin casinos. You can play all you want without divulging you real name. Just enter an alias when you sign up for an account. You will not be prevented from playing and claiming your winnings if you don’t want to reveal your identity.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Popular Bitcoin Casino Games</h2>

<p>The best bitcoin casinos carry the same range of popular games offered at traditional online casinos. These games include Bitcoin Blackjack, Bitcoin classic slots, Bitcoin bassed dice games, video slots, jackpot slots, roulette, Bitcoin poker / live Bitcoin poker, video poker, craps, table games, and casual games. </p>

<p>You may notice that some sites brag about having nearly a thousand games but these games are actually just variations of most popular games. There are also those that offer live casinos and some support manual shuffling. The most popular games being played on standard online casinos are basically just the same games played on bitcoin casinos.</p>
