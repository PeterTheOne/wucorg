Chris Pacia is a Senior Developer at OB1, the parent company of [OpenBazaar](/openbazaar/).

## Bitcoin Projects

Pacia has been involved with a wide variety of Bitcoin projects.

In early-2015, Pacia introduced a wallet called "Bitcoin Authenticator". The desktop wallet featured automatic 2-factor authentication by using multisignature with a smartphone as a second signing device. While the wallet received [positive feedback on reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/2r64wn/bitcoin_authenticator_decentralized_twofactor/), it appears that no further development is being done on the project.

In mid-2015, Pacia published [a Medium article](https://medium.com/@chrispacia/subspace-73059a1cff71) introducing [Subspace](https://github.com/cpacia/Subspace); a "messaging layer for Bitcoin". Development on Subspace also appears to have halted since Pacia joined OB1.

## Bitcoin Development

Pacia has been vocal about his disagreement with the current path of [Bitcoin Core](/bitcoin-core/) development. He has come out against proposals like Lightning Network and replace by fee, and supports scaling solutions through hard forks to increase the block size. His thoughts on these subjects can be found in the many articles published [on his blog](https://chrispacia.wordpress.com/).
