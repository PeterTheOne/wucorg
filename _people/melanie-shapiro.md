## Quotes

On how Case [is different from Trezor](http://www.coindesk.com/cryptolabs-announces-multisig-hardware-wallet-biometric-authentication/):

> The difference is that this is an actual wallet. You can take it with you. Trezor has to be plugged into your computer for you to use it. This plugs into nothing.

On [Case's purpose](http://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-hardware-wallet-case-raises-2-25-million-in-funding/):

> Bitcoin and other distributed ledger technologies facilitate the transfer of digital financial assets within cryptographically secured, immutable environments. Case acts as a secure signing device that streamlines this process without increasing the risk of compromising sensitive data.
