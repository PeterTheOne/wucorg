## Quotes

On why SatoshiTango [sells bitcoins through pre-paid cards](http://www.coindesk.com/bootstrapping-bitcoin-startup-amid-argentinas-financial-uncertainty/):

> We believe that if people are familiar with prepaid cards, why not use these? People are very happy because they understand when they buy a prepaid card, the card is ready to buy bitcoin, and the exact amount they have in their hands is what they can buy.

On [Bitcoin's future](http://www.coinnewsasia.com/satoshitango-bitcoin-is-disrupting-the-remittance-market-in-asia/):

> Bitcoin is going to change everything we know about money, value and the financial system. You donâ€™t need to understand the way it works. My grandmother uses Facebook and she knows nothing about TCP/IP. But know this: you will be using bitcoin in the future without even knowing. Bitcoin is a game changer.
