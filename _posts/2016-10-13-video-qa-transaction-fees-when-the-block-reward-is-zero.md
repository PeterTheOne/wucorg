<h2>TRANSCRIPT</h2>

Based on the incentives in the network, what happens to fees when the reward for generating new blocks goes to zero? Will miners keep mining? Will the network fees be reasonable? This will gradually happen between now and 2141. Presumable the reliance on the block reward drops while the number of transactions rises. Fees will go up not because it's getting more and more expensive but because you have more and more transactions paying the same fee or less. 

We know this is going to happen just as we knew the Halvening was going to happen, because bitcoin is a deterministic currency. We don't have to wait for the spokesperson from the Federal Reserve to come out and tell us what our interest rate is. We're getting better at optimisation. If we introduce all the optimisation and scaling things, we can do more than Visa - cheaper. We will manage capacity in a way that isn't fatal, failing to scale (gracefully) for 25 years.
