<p>The Isle of Man introduced regulations for digital currency businesses on 1 April 2015, and CoinCorner became the first cryptocurrency exchange in the world to fall under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2008 on the Isle of Man.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin and the Isle of Man</h2>
<p>The Isle of Man has welcomed Bitcoin-related businesses, with Head of e-commerce for the Isle of Man, Peter Greenhill, telling Business Insider, "The aim is to be the most attractive place in the world for cryptocurrency companies to work from.</p>
<p>The Isle of Man Government amended the Proceeds of Crime Act 2008, introducing regulations to cover Bitcoin companies, including exchanges, operating on the island from 1 April 2015. They believe that "A combination of regulation and encouragement can not only reverse Bitcoin's reputation, but also push it towards the mainstream. These businesses must now comply with the Isle of Man’s anti-money laundering (AML) laws.</p>
<h2>CoinCorner Expanding into Europe</h2>
<p>As of September 2015 CoinCorner began an expansion programme including supporting Euro payments and multiple languages on it's platform. German is the first of these languages allowing users to <a title="Kaufen bitcoin" href="https://www.coincorner.com/de" target="_blank">Kaufen Bitcoin</a> with Euro!
