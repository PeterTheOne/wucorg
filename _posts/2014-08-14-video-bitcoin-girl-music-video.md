<h2>TRANSCRIPT</h2>

Lyrics: 

Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh 

Bitcoin Girl!

She's been living in her Bitcoin world. 
I bet she's never had a Wall Street guy.
She kissed the Federal Reserve goodbye -
for digital dimes.

Bitcoin Girl!
She's been living in her Bitcoin world. 
where all her currency is peer-to-peer.
No regulations that can interfere -- 
unlike my tears.

And when she wakes up
she shakes up her "mine."
Because she knows what she wants:
it's finite supply.

That's when I realized
it is all decentralized!

She's a Bitcoin girl!
You know I've seen her in her Bitcoin world.
She's so over paper money,
which has no value intrinsically.
No stability.

D-o-o-o-o-o-ge

She's the Bitcoin Girl.
She's been living in her Bitcoin world.
Like her transactions I'm anonymous.
Look at her reading the Economist's
analysis.

Digital wallet in her pocket,
it's strange
that when I'm walking 
I'm rattling with loose change.

But there's hope for me yet,
after all,
I've got Internet! 

She's a Bitcoin girl.
She doesn't care that I can buy her pearls.
But maybe someday when my public key
creates a brand-new cryptocurrency
she'll pick me.

D-o-o-o-o--o-ge

She's the Bitcoin Girl, 
the Bitcoin Girl --
You know I'm in love with 
the Bitcoin Girl.
