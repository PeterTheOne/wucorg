<p>The dangers of custodial accounts; not your keys, not your money. Security practices for long-term vs. short-term storage, trading, and transacting. I don't leave any currency (crypto or fiat) in an exchange for longer than 15 minutes. I use these cryptocurrencies to pay my bills, so I transact very often. So far, I've only ever lost small amounts of bitcoin through stupid mistakes.</p>

<p>1. Don't leave your money on exchanges longer than you have to. If you day-trade, make sure you understand the risk that entails.</p>

<p>2. Organise a tiered storage system of hot and cold wallets, factoring in the amount of bitcoin you're storing, how you plan to use it (soon or not for a long time), and what security risks you're willing to take with each tier.</p>

<p>3. Use cold storage (i.e. paper wallets) for large amounts or for bitcoins you don't plan on using for a longer period of time.</p>

<p>4. Use hardware wallets that are PIN or password-protected </p>

<p>5. Use multi-signature multi-party or multi-factor wallets for carrying out your weekly business transactions.</p>

<p>6. Use hot wallets (ex. mobile wallets) for petty cash, or if you are the Oprah of cryptocurrency.</p>
