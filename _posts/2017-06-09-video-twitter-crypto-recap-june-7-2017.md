<p>Jesse told you to buy $GEO when it got delisted from Poloniex, now it’s up 25x….but Jesse is not selling yet. Get some Geocoins, if you don’t want to buy Geocoins you can always search for them and find them in their free game.</p>

<p>Jesse has been doing very well on Crypto trading for the last few years…Jesse says..now it’s time for the NOOBS to make some money in this game.</p>

<p>$CPC a good #HODL, great potential although it may be a long term hold.</p>

<p>If you are selling Bitcoins remember to send with the increased fees or you may get stuck in the men pool.</p>
