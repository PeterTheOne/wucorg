<p>BlockTrail provides secure bitcoin infrastructure for developers and enterprises, enabling advanced transaction functionality and access to refined economic data-sets.</p>
<p>Founded in 2014 and based in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, BlockTrail is dedicated to delivering better tools for the bitcoin economy. To help further this mission we offer three exciting products: BlockTrail Webwallet, Block Explorer and API.</p>

### Webwallet
<p>BlockTrail provides a webwallet with distinguishing features such as hierarchical deterministic (HD) capabilities, sub-wallets and multi signature security by default. When users create a BlockTrail webwallet, they automatically generate three key seeds in their browser, of which two are required to send funds. Two of the keys are kept by the user while the third key is held by BlockTrail, which uses it to co-sign transactions. The keys generated by users are handed as a PDF file, which users can optionally choose to store offline. The two seeds held on the file can restore any funds the wallet will hold, as well as any address it will ever generate.</p>

### Block Explorer
<p>We also absolutely love our block explorer; allowing any user to view realtime and historical data on bitcoin addresses, transactions and economy. Additionally, we allow for search via QR code, social address mentions and to top it all off you can bookmark any addresses.</p>

### API
<p>This brings us to our API development platform product. For the developers out there interested in creating their own app with bitcoin integration, we offer our easy-to-use SDK in your favorite programming languages. We also provide extensive documentation that covers all the API endpoints, details of the SDK usage for each language, and explains the technical features our API offers you.</p>
