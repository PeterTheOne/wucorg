<p>With the rise of cryptocurrency has come increased governmental scrutiny and regulatory action.
<p>For some users who do not like being thoroughly monitored with a spiked Roto-Rooter the market has begun to develop solutions with DASH, PIVX, ZCash and Monero.
<p>Currently, the best option for privacy and anonymity along with price appreciation is probably PIVX.

<p>The coins, current price each and market capitalization.
<ol>
<li>DASH - $141.28 - $1.036B</li>
<li>Monero - $42.49 - $619m</li>
<li>ZCash - $233.80 - $339m</li>
<li>PIVX - $1.66 - $89m</li>

<p>DASH is the largest of the 'private' coins. Many people are lulled into a sense of anonymity security with the Private Send feature.
<p>Private Send is a PrivateSend is an improved version of CoinJoin which includes features like decentralization and a chaining approach.
<p>This decentralized coin mixing service built within DASH's protocol enables fungibility of the currency.
<p>However, in October 2016 the DASH masternodes partnered with Coinfirm to produce Anti-Money Laundering and Know Your Customer support into the DASH blockchain.
<p>Thus, many users many be unaware of this change and would be surprised to know their transactions and identities are linked so thoroughly.

<p>Significant privacy is provided with ring confidential transactions at the protocol level.
<p>Coupled with stealth addresses for both sender and receiver and significant privacy is attained.
<p>A large problem is the blocksize resulting from the increased sizes of transactions. But the rules do enable an adaptive block size.
<p>Another cool feature will be the Kovri router which will enable the ability to conceal the origin node for transactions within I2P.

<p><h2 id="zcash">ZCash</h2>

<p>Zero-knowledge proofs are used to provide anonymity for users.
<p>A zero-knowledge proof enables verification of and privacy of data. Here, transaction amounts, sender and recipient addresses are all encrypted.
<p>Sure, blockchain analysts can correlate information through public transactions on the blockchain and users need to obfuscated their IP addresses when sending transactions.
<p>Finally, the protocol does not hide public data that may be linked to personal identifiers.

<p><h2 id="pivx">PIVX</h2>

<p>The ecosystem has an very interesting blend of governance. Like DASH it has masternodes but it also implements Proof of Stake.
<p><h3 id="staking">Optimized PIVX Staking</h3>
<p>When staking, the <b>larger the address balance the more will be earned</b>.
<p>For example, an address with about 15,000 PIVX will earn about 50% more per PIVX than an address with about 1,000 PIVX.
<p>Masternodes may earn more but there is a lot of hassle setting up and running them.
<p>You can estimate earnings with <a href="http://cryptonode.co/">Cryptonode</a>.
<p>The wallet needs to be opened and unlocked while connected to the Internet; so be careful with security.
<p>Addresses need to have at least 100 confirmations.
<p>Crazy Pro Tip - After an address gets 100 confirmations then restart the wallet and unlock it. Then the staking should be active for that balance.
