Ode To Satoshi

Well Satoshi Nakamoto that's a name I love to say
And we don't know much about him, but he came to save the day
When he wrote about the way things are 
and the way things ought to be

Oh Bitcoin as you're going into the old Blockchain
Oh Bitcoin I know you're going to reign, gonna reign
Till everybody knows, everybody knows, 
till everybody knows your name

Down the road it will be told about the Death of Old MtGox
About traitors trading alter coins and minors mining blocks

they're just wanting to be free

Oh Bitcoin as you're going into the old Blockchain
Oh Bitcoin I know you're going to reign, gonna reign
Till everybody knows, everybody knows, 
till everybody knows your name

From the ghettos of Calcutta to the halls of Parliament
While the bankers count Our money out for every government
Old Bitcoin flies on through the skies of Virtuality
A promise to deliver us from age old Tyranny

Oh Bitcoin as you're going into the old Blockchain
Oh Bitcoin I know you're going to reign, gonna reign
Till everybody knows, everybody knows, 
till everybody knows your name
Till everybody knows, everybody knows, 
till everybody knows your

"Give me some Exposure"

Everybody knows your name

Singing: 
Oh Lord pass me some more
Oh Lord before I have to go
Oh Lord pass me some more
Oh Lord . . . before I have to . . . 
go . . .

"Thanks East Nashville! Y'all be good to each other out there ya hear!"
