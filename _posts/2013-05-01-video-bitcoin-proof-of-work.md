<p>An explanation of cryptographic proof-of-work protocols, which are used in various cryptographic applications and in <a href="/we-use-coins-bitcoin-mining-guide/">bitcoin mining</a>. Traditional digital cash schemes solved the double spending problem by having a centralized (online) entity that could check for coins being spent repeatedly. Bitcoin provides a nifty solution that works without a centralized entity by leveraging the proof of work. As long as honest nodes control the majority of the collective computing power, it's an uphill battle for a dishonest node to successfully double spend. Instead, they are better off mining themselves.ï»¿</p>
