There were bitcoiners who received an email last February from the <a href="/bitcoin-economy-will-be-helpful-to-conceal-greeks-richness/">Egifter company</a> saying that the only accepted transactions are from Coinbase. Community members still thinks that the reason was because of transactions price and hypothesizes that Coinbase would aid the business  resolve off-chain.</p>
 
<p>Subsequent to these news, Bitpay announce they would increase the company’s invoice rates. Bitpay explained:</p>

<p>Coinbase explained that starting March 21, 2017 they will cease paying the on-chain transaction fees already.
