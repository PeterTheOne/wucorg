Jon Matonis is the Founding Director of the Bitcoin Foundation, and the CEO of Globitex, a Bitcoin exchange based in Luxembourg City. Matonis was one of a few people who vouched for [Craig Wright](/craig-wright/) as Satoshi in May 2016. He also worked at CoinDesk from September 2013 until January 2016.  

## Bitcoin Foundation

Matonis has been part of the Bitcoin Foundation since 2012. He originally served as the Executive Director.

## Craig Wright Satoshi Claims

In May 2016, Craig Wright attempted to prove to the world that he was Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of Bitcoin. Wright held private meetings with Matonis and Gavin Andresen. [According to Matonis](http://themonetaryfuture.blogspot.co.uk/2016/05/how-i-met-satoshi.html), Wright provided sufficient proof to back up his claims of being Satoshi. After Wright went public, it became quite clear that he [lacked the evidence needed](http://www.drcraigwright.net/) to prove his claims. 

Wright has yet to provide public proof that he is Satoshi. Despite this, Matonis still [claims and believes](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-36213588) that Wright is Satoshi.
