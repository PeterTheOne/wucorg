BTCC is one of China's largest Bitcoin companies. Its products include a Bitcoin mining pool, spot exchange, and pro exchange. 

## Mining Pool

[BTCC's mining pool](https://pool.btcc.com/) is available to customers around the globe and is currently the [third largest mining pool](https://www.bitcoinmining.com/bitcoin-mining-pools/) by total hash rate. 

The pool pays out using the PPS method. Individual miners receive quick payouts and are compensated for each share solved. 

## Spot Exchange

[BTCC's spot Bitcoin exchange](https://exchange.btcc.com/) is the third largest Bitcoin exchange in the world based on trading volume. 

Bobby Lee, BTCC's CEO, has often [accused](http://www.coindesk.com/reality-chinese-trading-volumes/) Chinese exchanges Huobi and OKCoin of fake trading volumes. While BTCC handles about 1% of global Bitcoin trading volume, Huobi and OKCoin's volumes amount to more than a [90% share](http://data.bitcoinity.org/markets/volume/30d?c=e&t=a) of global trading volume. 

## Pro Bitcoin Exchange

BTCC's [pro exchange](https://pro.btcc.com/) is one of its newest products. It allows traders to use up to 25x leverage. Its USD trading also marks BTCC's first entry into the U.S. market.
