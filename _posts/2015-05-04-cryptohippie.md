Cryptohippie, Inc. is a market leading provider of professional-level VPN protection. 
<p>
Cryptohippie (a suite of companies) was formed in 2007 through the acquisition of MeshMX, Diclave, and Roque Holdings - all of which were little-known but highly regarded providers of superior privacy enhancing technologies. We were the first to provide VPN-based privacy protection services to the market, beginning in early 2003. Cryptohippie's management and development teams are composed of seasoned professionals with long experience both in running enterprise-grade secure networks and operating businesses in the privacy market. 
<p>
### Mission
<p>
Cryptohippie’s mission is to protect individuality and privacy on the Internet – to prevent all transgressions against privacy, from whatever source. This is much more than pretty talk for us. Every person on our management team has a successful professional life outside of Cryptohippie. We do not have to do this – we do it because it matters. 
<p>
### Philosophy
<p>
We believe that human beings should live by reason, as individuals, with integrity, and with passion. Privacy allows that. Furthermore, we demand of our clients what we demand of ourselves: To demonstrate honesty and to show respect for the dignity of man, privacy, and for sound economic principles. All others need not apply.
