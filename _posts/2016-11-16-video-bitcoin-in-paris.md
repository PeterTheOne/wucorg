<p>The Passage du Grand Cerf, a covered walkway connecting Marie Stuard Street and Saint Denis Street, will become, from 17 November 2016, the first "boulevard boulevard" in Paris. This initiative, unpublished in France, was initiated by the association Cercle du Coin with the support of the <a href="/the-best-bitcoin-casinos/">Maison du Bitcoin</a>. It concerns about twenty shops of the gallery: shops, workshops of creators and shops of mouth.</p>
