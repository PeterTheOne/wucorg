<p>The <a href="/video-learn-about-zen-coin/">politics of Bitcoin</a>. Counter-economics. Politics is a conversation about how best to organise society. Contrary to what they want you to believe, it is not a conversation you can only have if you're an elected official wearing a blue/ red coloured pin, or participate in once every four years. </p>

<p>They want us to think that politics is the dirty business of choosing the lesser evil of two awful candidates who will mess up the lives of our neighbours who voted for the wrong one. That's tribalism and we don't need that. We're having a conversation about governance right now, without casting any votes or electing anyone. We are engaging in it every day. Creating local organisations and communities of people helping each other is the most powerful form of politics we have. Don't vote - code.</p>
