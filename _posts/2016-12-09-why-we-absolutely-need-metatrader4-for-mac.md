<p>I must admit, I’m a bit of a snob when it comes to Apple products. I own an iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch. But the MacBook is definitely the premium Apple product.
<p>It works far better than any other computer I’ve used. More importantly, I love using it. I get a thrill every time I open it up!
<p>One of the major downsides of owning a MacBook, however, has been the fact that MetaTrader 4 is Windows software. MetaTrader 4, if you're not aware, is the platform for <a href="http://www.admiralmarkets.com/">Forex and CFD trading</a> online. There is simply no other that compares.
<p>Which is why it’s so frustrating that <a href="http://www.admiralmarkets.com/trading-platforms/metatrader-4/for-mac">MetaTrader 4 for Mac</a> has been so long in coming.
<p>Up until recently, to use MetaTrader 4 on a MacBook you had to install Windows, which is really infuriating for someone like me, who loves macOS a little too much.
<p>Recently, however, Admiral Markets has started offering a version of MT4 for Mac, and it’s not a moment too soon. These are 3 reasons why we absolutely need MT4 for Mac.
<p><h2>1. Incomparable functionality</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MetaTrader_4">MetaTrader 4</a> is known as the best trading platform by a distance. Nearly all the best brokers offer it and with good reason.
<p>It’s functionality is incomparable, perfect in fact. Not even its supposed successor - MetaTrader 5 - could unseat it from its perch.
<p>Unlike other trading software, it is easy and intuitive to use. It never crashes or glitches. It is lightweight and executes trades quickly and easily. It has all the analytic tools you could possibly need and is fully customisable.
<p><h2>2. Once you go Mac... </h2>
<p>All MacBook users can appreciate how hard it is to go 'back' to other types of computers. They function differently. They're more advanced and just make so much more sense. And so, even if you have an old Windows laptop lying around which you can use for trading, it can be painful.
<p>What is even worse is using Windows on a MacBook. Not only does it feel wrong, but it also slows things down a whole lot.
<p><h2>3. We can’t wait for an alternative</h2>
<p>It’s nice to think that one day a Mac equivalent of MetaTrader 4 will be developed, but it seems that such a thing is not even in the pipelines.
<p>An alternative could take years to be developed, and why wait for something that would probably <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/university/meta-trader-guide-intro/">not match up to MT4</a>. And so, for Mac users, MetaTrader 4 is all we have to hope for.
<p><h2>It’s available and worth it</h2>
<p>Thankfully, the wait for MT4 for Mac is over. Brokers such as Admiral Markets offer the software for free. It is an emulated version, which makes it less lightweight than the Windows version.
<p>But it is incredibly reliable, and more stable than other options. The one downside is that automated trading is not advised because the software is emulated. I don’t quite trust automated trading in the first place, but if you like to use EAs and scripts, you might find yourself looking for alternatives.
