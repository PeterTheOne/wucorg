<h2>TRANSCRIPT</h2>

I’m here today to tell you all about the Cloudflare bug that might have exposed some of your sensitive information from exchanges like Kraken or Poloniex.

If you have accounts with these exchanges you probably received an email strongly suggesting to change your passwords, two-factor authentication and API keys. Cloudflare is a web security firm that provides denial-of-service protection. 

According to the blog post published by cloud fare, “the bug was serious because the leaked memory could contain private information and because it had been cached by search engines. The greatest period of impact was from Feb. 13-18.

Websites that were potentially affected by the bug include: Coinbase, BitPay, Blockchain, and LocalBitcoins.

This bug influenced more than just the crypto based sites, websites like Reddit, Uber and OKCupid were also affected.

Please share this video with anyone you think may have been effected by this security breach! They'll thank you for it.
