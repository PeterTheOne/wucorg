<p>Will Bitcoin become a <a href="/how-to-buy-bitcoins-with-credit-card-with-spectrocoin/">state-backed global currency</a>? As a reference of value for national fiat currencies. A mandatory one-world currency is statist monolith that can only be supported by war, coercion, and violence. It means one-world authority, one-world governance system. Bitcoin is a global currency, it is the de facto currency of the internet, but it doesn't represent a zero-sum game; it's a choice you have in addition to all the other alternatives that may be prohibited, that doesn't need to force anyone to use it. </p>

<p>It is an antiquated notion that a currency needs to be imposed on a border basis or an aggregation of states. As if the euro wasn't already bad enough, it would be a complete fascist dystopia if the EU replaced the euro with "a digital currency like bitcoin," because it is meaningless for a country to choose to use Bitcoin and they would not implement it unless it was a centralised nightmare of surveillance.</p>
