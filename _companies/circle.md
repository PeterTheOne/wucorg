Circle is a digital payments company. Circle uses blockchain technology to power its payments infrastructure behind the scenes. **It no longer allows users to buy and sell bitcoins.** See their [blog post for more information](https://blog.circle.com/2016/12/06/spark-new-markets-app-messaging-and-bitcoin-changes/) about the change.

## Payment App

Users can send US Dollars, British Pounds, and Euro to phone numbers and emails. Incoming payments are immediately converted into the recipient's preferred currency.

Although Circle launched as a [Bitcoin wallet](/en/find-the-best-bitcoin-wallet/) and exchange, it is now focused on becoming a global-social payment app.
