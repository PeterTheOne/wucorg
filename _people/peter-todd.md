## BIPs

### OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY (BIP 65)

[BIP 65](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0065.mediawiki) added "a new opcode (OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY) for the Bitcoin scripting system that allows a transaction output to be made unspendable until some point in the future."

In simpler terms, OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY allows you to send money that cannot be spent until a specified future date.

### Opt-in Full Replace-by-Fee Signaling (BIP 125)

[BIP 125](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0125.mediawiki) explained opt-in full-RBF. Transaction fees are rising and opt-in full-RBF allows senders with stuck transactions to send a new transaction with a higher fee. Opt-in RBF was merged in Bitcoin Core [version 0.12](https://bitcoin.org/en/release/v0.12.0).

### BIP 63

A BIP by Todd titled "Stealth Addresses" has been assigned BIP #63 but has yet to be published.
