<p>The <a href="/how-to-use-bitcoin-with-backpage/">principal-agent problem</a> and the agency-less (children and the disabled). The use of technology by people with cognitive or physical disabilities, the disadvantaged, the disempowered. Given sufficient good user-interface and software design, apps can help give you agency and gain power. </p>

<p>When you give the disabled power and agency, everyone else can also use that technology. Techno-utopianism. The pyramid scheme systems we have today not only don't give agency, but actively conspire to remove it from larger and larger segments of society until everyone is without agency.</p>
