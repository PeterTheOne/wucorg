<img src="/images/jeremy-gardner.png" alt="Jeremy Gardner" align="right">I have seemingly dedicated my life to cryptocurrencies and block chain technology over the course of the past year. I am the co-founder and executive director of the College Cryptocurrency Network (CCN), Director of Operations/Business Development at Augur, and serve as an official advisor to Bitcoin Shop.

More often, it was <a href=/what-is-litecoin/>Litecoin</a> or <a href=/what-is-dogecoin/>Dogecoin</a> that got them hooked on this technology.
