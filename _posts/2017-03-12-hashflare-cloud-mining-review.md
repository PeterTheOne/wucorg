<h2 id="history">HashFlare History</h2>

<p>On 23rd of April 2015, HashFlare has been <a href="/us-customs-agents-are-now-compelling-mobile-passwords/">launched officially by HashCoins</a> and that is because of those initial offer during end of 2014 on hosted mining contract. Both altcoins and Bitcoin has been offered by <a href="http://geni.us/hashflare">HashFlare for cloud mining service</a>. </p>

{% include page-toc.html %}

<p>Non-stock version of Apollo miner has been used for Bitcoin mining with SHA-256. On the other hand they utilized Ares miner for Scrypt mining. As a parent business, HashCoins company provides all hardware to use in their datacenter of two Megawatt. HashCoins was founded by Sergei Potapenko on 2013 and was based in Talin, Estonia.</p>

<p>HashFlare on 30th of June 2015, reached over Ten thousand consumers that are using their services of cloud mining with over 1 PH/S of hash rate generated.</p>

<h2 id="trust">Trust Rating</h2>

<p>Being the newest player in cloud mining industry, HashFlare <a href="/nigerian-central-bank-warned-bitcoin-users/">offered services such as Scrypt mining</a> and SHA-256 as mention above.  Considering that they are just newbie company of cloud mining and they don't have any archive to check for past payout history, I am not having any issues with them and I have been already using their services for a month now. </p>

<p>One thing that you can be assured of is that they provides details on their physical address of their company and also enumerated list of their members and with photos.  <a href="/march-13-not-11-deadline-of-btc-etf-by-sec/">You will also be amaze</a> that they have a feature like you can switch or change mining pools which of course other cloud mining company have it and no proof that a contract is just pointing to specific pool.</p>

<p>Photos of Bitcoin mining operation though hasn't been revealed yet but their mining operation of Scrypt and data center has shared photos already. One of their representatives explained that there's a difference on the looks of the racks between that of Apollo and Ares, which he added that Ares' racks are way more nicer. </p>

<p>On my on opinion, it would be better if at least they ask one of their technical guys to shoot one photo even if the look isn't that good. That 1 PH/S is an specification of about 900 Apollo V3s or more which consolidates to have at least 90 racks of 10. </p>

<p>I will be increasing my trust rate for them if in case I gain more evidence of their mining capacity. So you can check every now and then for new updates on the review.</p>

<h2 id="price">Price Rating</h2>

<p>More or less 0.00178 BTC/GHS contracts of Bitcoin cloud mining in HashFlare, which put them on the spot as most expensive contracts upon writing this review. On my list of reviews, there's only one company surpassed HashFlares rate and it's more expensive by one percent. On the industry, HashFlare is being tied as one of the highest rate in Bitcoin mining contract.</p>

<p>Having said that, they certainly offer discounts. One example for that is during 2015 summer which is ten percent off for purchase on 100GH/S  or even more, then twenty percent off on purchasing 5 TH/S or even more. </p>

<p>One they successfully purchase accounts then they can start using the services with lesser price. On the other hand they are also offering low price maintenance  fees which is affordable and you would love on their cloud mining services.</p>

<h2 id="maintenance">Maintenance Fee Rating</h2>

<p>Yes, they are the 2nd highest cloud mining contract overall but they also offered a very low maintenance cost that any cloud mining company has except those cloud mining companies that offers no fees for maintenance.  </p>

<p>It's remarkable to have USD 0.03/GH/month maintenance fee and that might be because of a lower electricity cost in Estonia and on that manner, it's the best thing also to happen after those no-fees maintenance. </p>

<p>The maintenance cost might drop even more considering that HashFlare is just mining with aged technology of Apollo and might switch to Uranus in the future. </p>

<h2 id="dashboard">Dashboard Rating</h2>

<p>HashFlare also has a very awesome <a href="/anxiety-of-chinese-miners-on-uasf/">cloud mining interface to work on</a>. On behalf of usability, I guess they offered to be one-third of the overall cloud mining companies with their features and stuffs. </p>

<p>The payments withdrawal also is very smooth and it has a two-way confirmation process of authentication that will be sent thru email. Their dashboard interface shows a graphical representation of balances, revenue per day / TH, earnings overtime and mining pool allocation. </p>

<p>All information were tabulated in an orderly manner. HashFlare's advantage  is the pool allocation of mining where users can choose or select pool that other companies don't have.</p>

<h2 id="reliability">Payment Reliability Rating</h2>

<p>HashFlare is on time in terms of all payments made and as expected, <a href="/the-price-of-counterparty-token-multiplies-by-2/">revenue was exact  when deducting maintenance fees</a>. While using only for one month on their service, they are really on track and everything runs smoothly. </p>

<p>When I tried withdrawing my Bitcoin from HashFlare account, it appears only Fifthteen minutes to appear in my wallet and that is fast transaction to the block chain.</p>

<h2 id="referral">HashFlare Referral</h2>

<p>HashFlare also offers a ten percent referral bonus which makes them the same with the highest rate cloud mining company offering discounts. They never offer signup bonus for this time but they have special offers from time to time. </p>

<p>In short HashFLare plays it well to receive a solid grade on generosity.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>HashFlare has a competitive price and a lot of offers like <a href="/dubai-to-host-a-new-world-blockchain-forum/">maintenance fees and bonuses</a>. They are not the most trusted cloud mining company though but they runs smoothly that in the future could gain more confidence from customers. </p>
