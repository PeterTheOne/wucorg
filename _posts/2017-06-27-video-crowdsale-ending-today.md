<p>New Venture Opportunities, or NVOExchange is creating a decentralized cryptocurrency wallet and exchange platform, removing the need for third parties to hold customer assets. NVO exchanges coins from secure storage to secure storage, and removes the need to deposit and withdraw cryptocurrency into centralized exchanges which gives the exchanges access to your private keys, losing control of your own funds.</p>

<p>NVO makes it easy for people who are new to cryptocurrencies to store their coins and exchange them for other coins without leaving the same wallet. With NVO, Assets are always under your control, and there are no proxy tokens, even during the exchange process. </p>
