[Case](https://choosecase.com/) is a multisignature Bitcoin hardware wallet.  

## How Case Works

Case is a stand-alone Bitcoin hardware wallet. It has its own screen, camera, and a fingerprint scanner for extra authentication. It is the only Bitcoin hardware wallet with built-in GSM, meaning it can connect to the internet automatically in over 100 countries.  

Because Case has its own screen, camera, and internet, it doesn't require a second device for use. 

As a 2-of-3 multisignature wallet, two signatures are needed to send a transaction. One key is held by the device owner, a second by Case, and a third key is stored by the user as a backup.
