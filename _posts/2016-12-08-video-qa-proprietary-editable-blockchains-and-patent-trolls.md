<p>Proprietary editable blockchains and patent trolls. Patents mainly slow down the commercial companies in the space that are interested in doing proprietary technology. Patent pools as a defense against expensive litigation. They're not going to affect the open-source voluntary-based software that we really care about, because you can't stop that with patents. </p>

<p>I've expressed my confusion as to why people are not seeing the desirability of irreversible contractual agreements between parties, which can still allow for refunds and multi-signature consumer protection. Irreversibility is not a bug, it's one of the most useful features. It is a system that encourages autonomy instead of authority. "Editable blockchain," in the passive voice, simply means a <a href="/eli-segwit/">blockchain which can be edited</a>, but then there is still the subject question of "by whom" and "under what circumstances"? </p>

<p>It is not a useful construct because we already have those, we already have institutional money and authoritarian systems of control and censorship. What we have now with Bitcoin is autonomy and censorship-resistance. Patenting something doesn't mean it's useful or interesting or novel.</p>
