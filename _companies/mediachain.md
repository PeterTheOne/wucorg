Building a more connected world for creators and audiences.

<a href="http://www.mediachain.io/">Mediachain</a> is a blockchain data solution for connecting applications to media and information about it.

## Uniting Information

Mediachain is a peer-to-peer, decentralized database for sharing information across applications and organizations.
Using content addressing, data is tamper-proof and decentralized, enabling location-independent collaboration with no central point of control.

## Unlocking Value

Today, publishers depend on centralized platforms for their identity, audience and monetization.
Using cryptography, all data in Mediachain stays connected to the identity of the author, offering a channel for attribution, analytics and value to flow directly.

## Sparking innovation

Increasingly, the consolidation of power in large platforms threatens our ability to innovate.
Open, shared data empowers developers, creators and organizations to innovate the ways we share, consume and experience media.
