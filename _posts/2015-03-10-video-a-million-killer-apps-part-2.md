<p>History has always been written by the victors. But beginning in 2009, this limitation has been disrupted. Designed to be electronic cash, Bitcoin has proved to be so much more. In this video we focus on <a href="/decrypting-bitcoin-documentary/">re-thinking the blockchain</a>, and understanding why this technology can prove to be revolutionary for how humanity records, remembers and keeps track of itself. Indeed by providing an immutable and transparent database, open to anyone, blockchain technology is destined to disrupt deeds, journalism, scientific publications, patents, artistic rights, and history itself. This is much more than a public ledger or proof of publication, this is a global shared history.</p>

<p>To understand these concepts, James takes you on a tour of the blockchain and the World Wide Ledger (WWL). If you've had trouble grasping blocks or chains or the combination thereof, this video is for you.</p>
