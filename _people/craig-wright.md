Craig Wright is an Australian theologist, computer scientist and businessman.

He was [falsely accused](http://www.wired.com/2015/12/bitcoins-creator-satoshi-nakamoto-is-probably-this-unknown-australian-genius/) of being Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto in December 2015.

## Satoshi Accusations

On December 11, 2015, [_Wired_](http://www.wired.com/2015/12/bitcoins-creator-satoshi-nakamoto-is-probably-this-unknown-australian-genius/) and [_Gizmodo_](http://gizmodo.com/this-australian-says-he-and-his-dead-friend-invented-bi-1746958692) published articles claiming that Craig Wright was Satoshi Nakamoto. 

Just days later, _Wired_ published [a new article](http://www.wired.com/2015/12/new-clues-suggest-satoshi-suspect-craig-wright-may-be-a-hoaxer/) titled: _New Clues Suggest Craig Wright, Suspected Bitcoin Creator, May Be a Hoaxer_. Like in 2014 when [_Newsweek_ claimed](http://www.newsweek.com/2014/03/14/face-behind-bitcoin-247957.html) that Dorian Nakamoto was Satoshi, Wired's attempt to out Satoshi also appear to be incorrect. 

On March 31, 2016, _Financial Times_ writer Izabella Kaminska [created new speculation](http://ftalphaville.ft.com/2016/03/31/2158024/craig-wrights-upcoming-big-reveal/) that Wright may indeed be Satoshi. Her article claimed Wright planned to prove himself as Satoshi to some of the Bitcoin community's respected figures. As of April 15, 2016, Wright has not presented any evidence.
