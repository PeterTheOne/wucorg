Roger Ver, sometimes known as _Bitcoin Jesus_, is the owner of Bitcoin.com, and an investor in many of the world's largest Bitcoin companies. He started investing in bitcoins in early 2011, and bought his first bitcoins at around $1. 

## Bitcoin.com

Ver owns the Bitcoin.com domain name. He originally rented out the domain to Chinese Bitcoin exchange OKCoin. After an argument over payments and terms of the agreements, Ver took back control of the site. 

Since then, Ver has updated the [Bitcoin.com](https://www.bitcoin.com/) site to include information on getting started with Bitcoin, a [forum](https://forum.bitcoin.com/), and a [news section](https://news.bitcoin.com/). 

## MemoryDealers

Ver founded [MemoryDealers](http://memorydealers.com/) in 1999. The company sells computer hardware, memory, and routers for low prices. 

## Investments

In his LinkedIn profile, [Ver claims](https://jp.linkedin.com/in/rogerver) to be the first person in the world to have invested in a Bitcoin startup. A list of his investments can be found below.
