Open <a href="https://www.weusecoins.com/blockchain-explained-for-normal-people/">blockchain networks</a> and <a href="https://www.weusecoins.com/video-bitcoin-and-cryptocurrency-safe/">cryptocurrencies</a> have made a new method to boost money to maintain and develop innovative goods and services – which may range from new cloud services found on the web, devices or gadgets on Internet of Things and of course even financial investments and products. This is considered an unusual method of crowdfunding which may bring different policy and legal questions, investors and developers are anxious to learn the answers to these queries so that they may be able to take advantage securely and safely of this new innovative model.

<h2>How It Works</h2>

Let us take a typical web service for instance: cloud storage. The conventional standard for this kind of service is Dropbox, in which it enables its clients to give Dropbox a month to month fee in order for them to keep their files and documents on the company’s hard drives which are Internet-connected for the purpose that these files can be readily accessible anytime, anywhere. A privately owned company, Dropbox raised funds from private investors in order to back the advancement of the so called service, in which this is service is built as well on infrastructures owned by private companies (i.e. server farms) that interfaces with the open Internet. 

For an instance where a blockchain network that is open is employed, there are two things which can be unique in relation to his conventional model.  (1) Developers can get paid in an unexpected way. Rather than raising funds from investors, the developers can instead utilize a blockchain to monitor a rare token, which can sometimes be termed an “appcoin” (shortened term for applicaton coin). 

The developers can then give away or sell the token to individuals who needs to utilize the given storage service or for individuals who opts to help it improvement. These token’s sale can able to fund the development and service’s maintenance in which the sale can occur sometime recently, amid or after the service’s development. (2) The service’s considered <a href="https://www.weusecoins.com/video-p2p-money-historical-context/">peer-to-peer (p2p)</a>. 

The cloud storage service users themselves include the framework that powers the administration (there’s no server farm) and the individual clients can be remunerated for their commitments to that foundation (i.e. the extra space on their hard drives which are internet-connected) with the token.  

<h2>These Tools Provide An Alternative Means to Monetize Open Platforms</h2>

A platform for messaging that is closed (like for example Google’s Hangouts or Apple’s iMessage) only enables users to send messages to other enlisted users of this kind of service while a platform that is open (for example SMS text messaging or email) enables users to send messages to anyone who has cellular- or Internet-connected device. 

In the case of closed platforms, essential programs may be proprietary, entry is accompanied by charge, and numerous services may not interoperate (for example, music bought from iTunes cannot be placed to Google Play should the client resolve to change from one music shop platform to another). Once established, a conventional company may not have the drive to bare their platform. 

Open platforms are known to be tedious to make for it has been primitively tough to fund them although they become profitable—they are civil commodities by nature. But the creators of a service for cloud storage can integrate a limited entry token, referred to as an appcoin, into the architecture, disseminate such token to other clients, preserve a bunch of such token for their own interest, and should the platform gain reputation, the token (along with the creators’ properties) will increase in worth and reward the creators for offering a civil commodity. This fresh model questions the idea of equity as conventionally comprehended, and brings completely diverse risks and prizes.

<h2>The Growing Trend of Appcoin Crowdfunding</h2>

The creators of these services as well as their promising investors have been advancing to reap the benefits of these new ventures. Storj, Swarm, and IPFS are developing cloud storage services and such services may be backed by tokens (Storjcoin, <a href="https://www.weusecoins.com/video-distributed-consensus-summary-and-review/">Ether</a>, and Filecoin respectively). Counterparty, Ethereum, and others are developing cloud computing power services all the while using tokens (XCP and Ether respectively). 

Mediachain, <a href="https://www.weusecoins.com/video-steemit-roadmap-2017/">Steemit</a>, and others are developing content-curation services and attribution services (similar to Steemit, few are already token-supported, while others aren’t but may desire to incorporate tokens sooner or later). This tally is lacking and new services as well as creators arise week by week. At the same time, investors curious in assisting monetary applications based on open networks have started observing whether or not they can purchase and cling on to tokens instead of having possession interests in the companies creating these networks.
