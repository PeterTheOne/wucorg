<p>In this Q&A segment, Andreas talks about the <a href="/bitcoin-arbitrage-made-easy-lesson-one/">progression of mining performance</a> from CPU to ASIC and how that created strong centralization. But now that we have arrived at the highest silicon fabrication density (at or below 16nm), the entire industry is bound by a much slower process, with 2x increase every 18 months at best. This new dynamic removes many of the incentives to centralization of mining.</p>
