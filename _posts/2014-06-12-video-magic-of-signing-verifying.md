<p>There is nothing more magical in Bitcoin, or all of cryptography than <a href="/bitcoin-multi-signature-fragmented-backups/">digital signatures</a>. And the most magical step of all is the verification. This is the step we focus on in this video, generating the entire process in just 50 lines of code (no imports or special function calls!) and watching as the Private Key falls out of the math entirely! So beautiful. The receiver is left with proof of the sender, confirmation of the message and no way of retrieving the senders private key. </p>
