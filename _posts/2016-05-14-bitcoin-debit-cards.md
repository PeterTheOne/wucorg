Bitcoin debit cards help bridge the Bitcoin world with traditional finance. By loading up a debit card with bitcoins, it becomes possible to spend bitcoins at almost any credit card accepting merchant. 

While Bitcoin debit cards don't allow users to spend bitcoins directly, they at least allow people to store balances in bitcoin. Since most debit card top ups only take a few seconds to confirm, bitcoin balances can be held up until the need to spend. 

## Cryptopay VISA Debit Card

The oldest and most established Bitcoin debit card, [Cryptopay's VISA card](http://geni.us/cryptopay) with over 23,000 issued. Cryptopay has made it simple for customers to spend bitcoins at millions of businesses around the world.

For purchases both online and offline, Cryptopay makes the process convenient for users and easier than ever for merchants.

There are both plastic and virtual debit cards issued. Cryptopay customers are not required to complete ID verification provided if they are happy to stay within the lower debit card limits. It is possible to stay anonymous where desired.

Costs range between €15.00, £15.00, $15.00 and €2.50, £2.50, $2.50 depending on currency, location and card limits.

## BitPay VISA Debit Card

Although the newest Bitcoin debit card, [BitPay's VISA card](https://bitpay.com/visa/) is perhaps the most exciting of the bunch. It is the first Bitcoin debit card that is available to US residents from all 50 states. 

BitPay's debit card costs $9.95 to order, and arrives 7-10 days after purchase. It can be used online, in-person, and also works with any ATM that works with VISA cards.  

Unlike Shift's debit card (featured below), deposits lock in value in dollars. Shift's debit card spends directly from your Coinbase balance, which creates an accounting nightmare for capital gains taxes when it comes time to file. 

## Xapo Debit Card

[Xapo's debit card](https://xapo.com/card/) was the first to market. It is available in most European countries, but not the United States. 

The Xapo debit card costs $20 and also has an annual fee of $12. Once ordered, the card takes 10-25 days to be delivered. It debits funds directly from your Xapo web wallet. 

## Coinbase / Shift Card

[Shift](https://www.shiftpayments.com/) was the first Bitcoin debit card available to U.S. residents. It is currently [available](https://support.coinbase.com/customer/portal/articles/2228646) to residents in 41 U.S. states. 

The Shift card connects to your Coinbase account. For each debit card purchase, it automatically withdrawals the necessary amount of bitcoins based on the dollar value of the transaction. 

For now, the Shift card is completely free to use but costs $10 to purchase. Shift and Coinbase have both stated that in the future there will be transaction fees for each purchase.
