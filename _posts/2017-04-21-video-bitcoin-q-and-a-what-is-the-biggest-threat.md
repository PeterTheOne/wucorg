<p>The biggest threats to Bitcoin. Bitcoin is not just a technology, it is also a community - which is vulnerable to injections of disinformation and drama. Every activist network eventually gets infiltrated and filled with propaganda by either idiots or people who are paid to do this as a job (Reddit, I'm talking about you). My advice is to focus on the technology, which is real. Community fragmentation slows things down. If the brightest programmers are spending their days dealing with trolls, they're not writing code, and that's a danger.</p>
