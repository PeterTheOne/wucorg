<p>Recently, I went to the Philippines for a short vacation.</p>

<p>I exchanged some money in Bank of Taiwan beforehand just to find out I was massively <strong>ripped off</strong> by a huge <strong>spread of ~30%</strong>.</p>

<p>One of my Filipino facebook friends advised me to use a local service instead - <a href="http://geni.us/coinsph">Coins.ph</a>.</p>

<p>It allows you to <strong>cash out using Bitcoin</strong>. It's instant and most importantly FREE!</p>

<p>If you're traveling in the Philippines, Coins.ph will <strong>save you a lot of money</strong> and hassle.</p>

<p>Let's set up an account first.</p>

<p>I recommend you to download their mobile app which is very convenient to use.</p>

<p>You may also use their website. The choice is yours, however, I'll be explaining the steps with the iOS app.</p>

<p>If you use a mobile app please use "pzf798" as the referral code.</p>

<p>You will instantly <strong>get 24 pesos for free</strong> and I'll get the same amount when you fund your account.</p>

<h2>Limits & Verification</h2>

<p>After your account is set up, verify it in order to raise your "cash out" limits from 0 to 50 000 pesos. Unfortunately, this step is necessary and there's no way around it.</p>

<p><strong>Scan your ID</strong> such as passport and upload it <a href="https://coins.ph/limits/identity-verification">here</a>.</p>

<p>Next <strong>take a selfie</strong> with the ID and upload it <a href="https://coins.ph/app/selfie-verification/intro">here</a>.</p>

<p>Make sure both images are of a good quality.</p>

<p>On their website, they claim the process may take up to a few business days, In my case, my account was <strong>verified within an hour</strong>.<p/>

<h2>Fund your Account with Bitcoins</h2>

<p>Next step is to fund your Coins.ph account with bitcoins.</p>

<p>Make sure to have <strong>at least 500 pesos</strong> worth of bitcoins which in the time of writing is around 0.012BTC.</p>

<p><strong>1.</strong> Swipe to the left to view the Bitcoin Wallet and click Receive.</p>

<p><center><img src="/images/bc-1-1.PNG" alt=""/></center></p>

<p><strong>2.</strong> Send bitcoins to the given wallet address.</p>

<p>If you use breadwallet it will automatically offer to send bitcoins to a copied address.</p>

<p><center><img src="/images/bc-1-2.jpg" alt=""/></center></p>

<p>Coins.ph considers a transaction <strong>valid after 3 confirmations</strong> so you should have your <strong>funds ready within 30 minutes</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>3.</strong> Go back to your Bitcoin Wallet and click Convert to <strong>sell your bitcoins</strong> for Filipino Pesos.</p>

<p><center><img src="/images/bc-1-3.jpg" alt=""/></center></p>

<p>This will fund your Peso Wallet, so swipe right to see the main screen.</p>
 
<p><strong>4.</strong> Click Cash Out at the bottom navigation bar.</p>
 
<p><center><img src="/images/bc-1-4.PNG" alt=""/></center></p>
 
<p><strong>5.</strong> Click Cardless ATM Instant Payout (24/7) and then eGiveCash.</p>

<p><center><img src="/images/bc-1-5.PNG" alt=""/></center></p>

<p><center><img src="/images/bc-1-5-2.png" alt=""/></center></p>

<p><strong>6.</strong> Type in the amount in pesos that you want to cash out.</p>
  
<p>The <strong>minimum is 500 pesos</strong>, the maximum depends on your verification level.</p>

<p><center><img src="/images/bc-1-6.PNG" alt=""/></center></p>

<p>Next, you'll be prompted to type in a receiver's (yours) information such as name, phone number, and email.</p>

<p>Make sure to have an access to a Filipino number!</p>

<p>I used a <strong>SIM card from Globe network</strong> which you can get in almost every store for 40 pesos (or free at main airports).</p>

<p><strong>7.</strong> After filling out the form you'll be taken to a summary page.</p>

<p><center><img src="/images/bc-1-7.jpg" alt=""/></center></p>

<p><center><img src="/images/bc-1-7-2.jpg" alt=""/></center></p>

<p>You will also receive an <strong>SMS with a 16-digit number and an email with a 4-digit passcode</strong>.</p>

<p>Have these 2 numbers ready.</p>

<h2>Withdraw Filipino Pesos</h2>

<p>Currently, only <strong>Security Bank</strong> lets you <strong>withdraw cash from an ATM for free</strong>.</p>

<p>The process is very easy and <strong>no ATM card is needed</strong>. All you need is the mentioned 16-digit eGiveCash number and 4-digit passcode.</p>

<p>I'm sorry, I have no photos of the process because it was sunny and I couldn't see shit on the phone.</p>

<p>The process is however very easy:</p>

<p><strong>1.</strong> Find the nearest Security Bank ATM in your area.</p>

<p><center><img src="/images/bc-2-1.jpg" alt=""/></center></p>

<p><strong>2.</strong> Press Enter to activate the ATM menu and click EGIVECASH CASH-OUT.</p>

<p><strong>3.</strong> Type in the 16-digit eGC number followed by the 4-digit passcode.</p>

<p><strong>4.</strong> Confirm the transaction and walk away with your pesos.</p>

<p>I was very pleasantly surprised with the service.</p>

<p>Coins.ph mobile app is very easy to use and the <strong>money transfer was instant</strong> and without any fees as advertised.</p>

<p>There is, of course, a "hidden cost" in the form of a <strong>slightly higher exchange rate</strong>.</p>

<p>The real cost for withdrawing 3200 pesos via Security Bank ATM was around 90 pesos, which I think is fair.</p>

<p>If you travel to the Philippines and don't want to get ripped off by banks or local exchange services, Coins.php offers you a convenient and cheap way to cash out your bitcoins.</p>
