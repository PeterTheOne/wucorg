Global commerce is rapidly changing. Businesses are increasingly global from day one and consumers are programmed to expect on demand delivery of services and information. Yet, the current infrastructure for payments is woefully inadequate to meet these needs.

<a href="https://ripple.com/">Ripple</a> works with banks to transform how they send money around the world — a necessary step to compete in today’s growing economy. Our vision is to enable the Internet of Value so the world can move value the way it moves information today.

## Why Ripple?

Using Ripple, banks can meet growing demands for faster, low-cost, on-demand global payment services for any payment size. The result: new revenue opportunities, lower processing costs, and better overall customer experiences.

## Quantify Your Bank’s Efficiency Gains

Using Ripple, your bank can acquire new customers and grow revenue through differentiated products and services. In addition to that, Ripple lowers your bank’s back-office costs through an efficient mechanism to process and settle international payments. This model allows you to estimate the efficiency gains your bank can achieve using Ripple for international payments.
