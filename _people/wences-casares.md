Wences Casares is the Founder & CEO of Xapo, and a Board Member at PayPal. Previously, Casares founded Lemon, which he [sold](http://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/blog/2013/12/lemon-sold-to-lifelock-for-426-million.html) to LifeLock for $42.6 million in 2013. 

## Xapo

Casares grew up in Argentina, where his parents were farmers. He [claims](http://www.theverge.com/2014/8/29/6082195/the-fort-knox-of-bitcoin-xapo-wences-casares) his parents lost their savings multiple times because of inflation. 

After Casares discovered Bitcoin in 2011, he could not find an easy way to store his coins.

With Xapo, Casares solved both his parents' problem and his own. It allows anyone world to securely store Bitcoins--a currency resistant to government inflation.  

Xapo has raised [over $40 million in VC funding](https://www.weusecoins.com/en/venture-capital-investments-in-bitcoin-and-blockchain-companies/). 

## PayPal

In January 2016, PayPal [appointed](http://fortune.com/2016/01/13/paypal-adds-wences-casares-to-board/) Casares as a Member of its board.
