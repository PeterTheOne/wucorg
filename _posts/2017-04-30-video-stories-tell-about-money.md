<p>In this talk, Andreas recounts the <a href="/monetary-theory-monetary-history/">history of Bitcoin</a> and what it represents, building upon all the stories we've been told over the centuries about what "money" is, how we perceive its value, and why the old answers have changed as we adjust to this new world of digital peer-to-peer currencies. He also discusses global threats to economic stability and trust in the financial system, including demonetisation and wealth destruction through inflation.</p>
