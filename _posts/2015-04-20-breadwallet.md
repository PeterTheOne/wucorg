### THE FIRST STANDALONE iPHONE BITCOIN WALLET
<img src="/images/breadwallet.png" alt="Breadwallet" align="right"><p>Unlike other iPhone wallets, breadwallet is a real standalone bitcoin client. There is no server to get hacked or go down, so you can always access your money. Using SPV mode, breadwallet connects directly to the bitcoin network with the fast performance you need on a mobile device.
### THE NEXT STEP IN WALLET SECURITY
<p>breadwallet is designed to protect you from malware, browser security holes and even physical theft. With AES hardware encryption, app sandboxing, keychain and code signatures, breadwallet represents a significant security advance over web and desktop wallets, and other mobile platforms.
### BEAUTIFUL SIMPLICITY
<img src="/images/breadwallet-demo.png" alt="Breadwallet demo" align="left"><p>Simplicity is breadwallet's core design principle. A simple recovery phrase is all you need to restore your wallet on another phone if yours is ever lost. Because breadwallet is "deterministic", your balance and entire transaction history can be restored from just your recovery phrase.
