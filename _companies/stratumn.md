Global organizations need to work together to deliver the best products and services to their customers, while at the same time satisfying requirements of regulatory authorities.

With information often locked behind firewalls and regulators asking for more proof, companies are facing impossible challenges.

## How it Works

Proof of Process defines how companies collaborate on the same process by securing the “who, what, when, where and why” of each step in a cryptographic audit trail.

## Who?

PoP uses digital signatures and integrates with existing infrastructure to securely record the participant’s actions in each step in a process.

With each step signed, we begin to form the cryptographic audit trail.

## What?

There are many things we need to prove to our partners and regulators without risking our privacy.

Proof of Process leverages powerful algorithms that allow us to create cryptographic proofs of our secrets.

## When?

It is critical that partners who work together have their systems completely synchronized.

Proof of Process uses blockchain technology to establish a common timeline that guarantees accurate timekeeping for each step in the process.

## Where?

Make sure to not put the cart before the horse. With Proof of Process partners working together can be sure of the correct sequence of events. When all partners agree things move smoothly.

## Why?

Unless you were born in the blockchain, you’ll need your cryptographic proofs to mean something in the real world. Proof of Process allows us to connect each step of a process with legally binding documents and contracts.
