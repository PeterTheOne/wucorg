## Description

Funderbeam is a primary and secondary market for early-stage startup investments. It makes growth capital easier to both deliver and access, across borders and without irrelevant intermediaries.

## Digital Tokens & Pooled Investments

Using advanced blockchain technology, investments are tokenized. Each digital token represents its ownerâ€™s rights in an investment syndicate. Using this syndicate model, companies can raise a round privately with experienced investors and or publicly with the crowd, while only adding one investor, the syndicate lead, to their cap table.

## Liquidity Through Trading

Investors can trade tokens on Funderbeam's secondary market. The process is quick, easy, and not hindered by national borders. Trading delivers a quick path to liquidity for sellers and frees investors from having to keep their investment for years. As token ownership and transactions are recorded on the blockchain, investing and trading on Funderbeam are transparent and secure.

## Great For Startup Founders 

With Funderbeam, founders can spend less time fundraising and focus on growing the company. Syndicated funding brings startups the money and expertise of lead investors, and the pooled capital of passive backers. Founders can raise larger rounds while gaining evangelists who have an interest in the company's success.

## From Data To Exit 

Funderbeam covers all steps in the investment lifecycle, from initial screening (global database of startups and investors) to syndicate creation, management and exit. Each step takes place directly on the platform. The outcome? More effective investing for everyone.

## Standalone Data Intelligence

Want to analyze startups anywhere in the world, but don't need to invest or raise funds on our marketplace? Funderbeam has a suite of standalone online tools for startup discovery and analysis. More than a dozen powerful search filters, deep profiles, competitor mapping, startup and investor tracking, and predictive analytics are available for a low monthly subscription.
