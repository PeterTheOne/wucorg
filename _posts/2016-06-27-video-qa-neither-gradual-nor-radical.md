<p><a href="/blockchain-use-to-allow-faster-overseas-remittance/">Decentralization as the final goal</a>: will the transition be through radical change or a gradual transformation? Disruptive innovation never works in a gradual fashion, rather punctuated equilibrium. We see this in science, technology, politics, and society. </p>

<p>Systems build up energy until it reaches a tipping-point event. Mainstream adoption won't be done because of a whim but because of a desperate need to escape failing systems. We don't need the acceptance or permission of the old traditional systems; people will opt-in when they are ready because these technologies are useful. "Innovation from within" with large organizations doesn't happen; most get disrupted from the outside and few survive in their original form.</p>
