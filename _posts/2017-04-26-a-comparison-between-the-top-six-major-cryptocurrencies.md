<p>Like most cryptocurrency users are very knowledgeable of, there are <a href="/us-customs-agents-are-now-compelling-mobile-passwords/">various currency groups</a> that should be taken into account. The dominant cryptocurrencies all offers something that’s likely different, though several are mostly clones that are copy-pasted. There is some big difference however between those dominant cryptocurrencies, because if not the difference between would be insignificant to discuss about.</p>

<h2>6. DASH</h2>

<p>One of the major thing that Dash work well is giving its users an added privacy <a href="/nigerian-central-bank-warned-bitcoin-users/">upon completing transacitons</a>. The Dash Masternodes network gives these services, while incentivizing as well the users in order not to spend their balance in the wallet. To add, Dash is forming quite an impact with regards to the industry of point-of-sale, through strategic partnerships. With all the things considered, Dash gives helpful service to people aiming for those traits specifically.</p>
 
<h2>5. MONERO</h2>

<p>Upon finding cryptocurrencies that are anonymous, someone has to see well beyond bitcoin as well as others. Monero is the one leading in the race of anonymity because of some innovative concepts. Monero has been cuddled also by darknet markets since it gives privacy and anonymity that can’t be seen in bitcoin. Though, Monero’s other use cases are somewhat limited.</p>
 
<h2>4. RIPPLE</h2>

<p>Even though several have quite conflicting opinions with regads to Ripple, one can’t simply not mind the benefits it has brought to the table. Not like other cryptocurrencies, Ripple’s not nearly speculation, however it firmly targets the transactional utility. Quite a few dozen of banks globally are aiming at Ripple to make their transaction better as well as other operations daily moving forward. Over the last few days, the <a href="/march-13-not-11-deadline-of-btc-etf-by-sec/">XRP token of Ripple</a> saw a significantly price increase because of a new banking collaboration.</p>
 
<h2>3. ETHEREUM</h2>
 
<p><center><img src="/images/top-btc-4.jpg" alt="currency comparison"/></center></p>
 
<p>Since the last years or so, several people differentiated Ethereum to Bitcoin. It is like a comparison between oranges and apples, since these two ecosystems have nothing alike. Ethereum focuses primarily on the blockchain development’s technical side which includes native tokens, decentralized applications and smart contracts. There’s a possibility that all of these characteristics will be available in bitcoin in the long run, but it’s good to be competitive in the cryptocurrency ecosystem.</p>
 
<h2>2. LITECOIN</h2>
 
<p><center><img src="/images/top-btc-5.jpg" alt="currency comparison"/></center></p>
 
<p>Litecoin, according to a number of people, is either a clone of bitcoin or considered one of the 1st original” outcomes to acquire traction. Litecoin gives out a distinct mining algorithm and transactions which are faster. Amazingly enough, some development similarities exists between litecoin and bitcoin. For example, <a href="/anxiety-of-chinese-miners-on-uasf/">Segrated Witness</a>, may activate very well on the network of litecoin first before it goes into effect among users of bitcoin. Litecoin which is considered a payment solution is accepted in various places, but it is far away from the bitcoin’s acceptance level.</p>
 
<h2>1. BITCOIN</h2>
 
<p><center><img src="/images/top-btc-6.jpg" alt="currency comparison"/></center></p>
 
<p>Bitcoin’s success is impossible to ignore. Although bitcoin has problems also that needs to be addressed like privacy and scalability, it has been the leading cryptocurrency in the world with relative ease. <a href="/the-price-of-counterparty-token-multiplies-by-2/">Bitcoins is fashioned to boost</a> financial inclusion and possibly make global transactions. Furthermore, a great number of merchants worldwide are starting to accept bitcoin as payments, both in offline and online world.</p>
