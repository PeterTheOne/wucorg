<p>Bitcoin being attacked by state-sponsored actors. <a href="/video-bitcoin-for-beginners/">Bitcoin is currently poking</a> the $100 trillion banking industry. If they use some kind of internal consensus attack to thwart its ability to develop new blocks (essentially denial-of-service), it would be noticed pretty quickly and lead to counter-measures. When something attacks you and you develop counter-measures, that's a form of immunity; through immunity you have evolution of resistance to that kind of attack. </p>

<p>Bitcoin is a decentralised system with independent actors who are guiding its evolution towards protection against systemic attacks. The well-funded opponents are essentially training Bitcoin on how to inoculate itself. It is very hard to go after a decentralised system. This talk took place on September 13th 2016 at the Silicon Valley Bitcoin Meetup in Sunnyvale, California.</p>
