<p>This talk was given at a local TEDx event, produced independently of the TED Conferences. Dug Campbell explains why Bitcoin is not just the money of the Internet, but it’s the Internet of money.</p>

<p>He has been avidly following the impact of technology on society since the late 90’s and he’s convinced that the cat’s out of the bag when it comes to digital currency. As well as working as Product Marketing Manager at Skyscanner, he writes on how <a href="/bitcoin-changetip/">digital networks</a> continue to influence the modern world. Oh, and he’s pretty sure the robots are coming, but doesn’t want to give an exact date.</p>
