<a href="https://storj.io/">Storj</a> is a Blockchain-based, end-to-end encrypted, distributed object storage, where only you have access to your data.

A peer-to-peer cloud storage network implementing client-side encryption would allow users to transfer and share data without reliance on a third party storage provider. The removal of central controls would mitigate most traditional data failures and outages, as well as significantly increase security, privacy, and data control. 

Peer-to-peer networks are generally unfeasible for production storage systems, as data availability is a function of popularity, rather than utility. They propose a solution in the form of a challenge-response verification system coupled with direct payments. In this way we can periodically check data integrity, and offer rewards to peers maintaining data. They further propose a model for addressing access and performance concerns with a set of independent or
federated nodes.
