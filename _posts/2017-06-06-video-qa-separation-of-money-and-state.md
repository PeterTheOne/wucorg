<p>Will criminal elements <a href="/how-to-use-mycelium-bitcoin-wallet/">leverage cryptocurrencies</a>? Criminal organizations as early adopters of technology, operating at the nexus of highest risk and highest reward. Money, by definition, is something you can use to buy anything. The more restrictions it comes with, the more it loses the fundamental principle of medium of exchange. I bet it's a lot easier to buy drugs with the New Zealand dollar than it is with bitcoin. </p>

<p>Criminals will use money, but what we need to understand is that the tool is not the crime and has never been the crime. 99% of humanity is going to use money and other tools to feed our children, give them healthcare, education, and a better future. </p>

<p>I'm not concerned with solving crime through attempting to control money. The organization you give the absolute power over money to, will become the criminal and punish not other criminals but their political opponents. We need to start thinking about separation of money and state, and understand that it just as important as the separation of church and state.</p>
