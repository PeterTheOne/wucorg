<h2>TRANSCRIPT</h2>
Bitcoin is going to change the way we transfer money across borders.  It's going to make it so that we no longer have to pay two-and-a-half to 5% to credit card companies.  And it's going to make it so that countries who have fiat currencies that are depreciating in value are going to have an alternative that they can use that is exchangeable anywhere in the world.  So I think that there are going to be some amazing changes in financial technologies and I'm really looking forward to what those all are and I'm pushing them forward because I know that it's better to be the one encouraging the change in your own industry than the one getting surprised by.
