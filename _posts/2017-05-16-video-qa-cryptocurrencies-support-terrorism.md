<p>Can cryptocurrencies be used to support terrorist groups? First we'd have to displace their most <a href="/sample-bankchain-feature-set/">important funding mechanisms</a>, which are the US dollar and oil (some of which our governments gave to them directly). We live in a world where criminals use technology (money, telephones, shoes), but we don't ban those technologies just because criminals use them. Most of humanity will use them for food, sanitation, healthcare etc. It is a fake promise that we're going to stop terrorism by controlling everyone's money, because all it does is exclude billions of people from the global financial system.</p>
