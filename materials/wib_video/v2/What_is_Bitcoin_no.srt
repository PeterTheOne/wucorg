00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:01,800
Hva er Bitcoin?

2
00:00:01,900 --> 00:00:04,900
Bitcoin er den første
desentraliserte digitale valutaen.

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:07,800
Bitcoins are digital coins
you can send through the Internet.

4
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:11,600
Compared to other alternatives,
bitcoins have a number of advantages.

5
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:15,000
Bitcoins are transferred directly
from person to person via the net

6
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:17,160
without going through
a bank or clearinghouse.

7
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:19,520
This means that the fees are much lower,

8
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,120
you can use them in every country,

9
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:22,900
your account cannot be frozen

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,500
and there are no prerequisites
or arbitrary limits.

11
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:28,000
Let's look at how it works.

12
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:31,400
Several currency exchanges exist
where you can buy and sell bitcoins

13
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:33,450
for dollars, euros and more.

14
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,400
Your bitcoins are kept in your digital
wallet on your computer or mobile device.

15
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:42,100
Sending bitcoins is as
simple as sending an email

16
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:45,100
and you can purchase
anything with Bitcoin.

17
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:49,500
The Bitcoin network is secured
by individuals called miners.

18
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:55,120
Miners are rewarded newly generated
bitcoins for verifying transactions.

19
00:00:55,300 --> 00:01:00,400
After transactions are verified they are
recorded in a transparent public ledger.

20
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:04,200
Bitcoin opens up a whole
new platform for innovation.

21
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,120
The software is completely open source
and anyone can review the code.

22
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:12,500
Bitcoin is changing finance the same way
the web changed publishing.

23
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:16,400
When everyone has access to a
global market, great ideas flourish!

24
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:21,100
Bitcoins are a great way for businesses
to minimize transaction fees.

25
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:24,450
It doesn't cost anything to start
accepting them and it's easy to setup.

26
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:28,900
There are no chargebacks and you'll get
additional business from the Bitcoin economy.

27
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:36,760
