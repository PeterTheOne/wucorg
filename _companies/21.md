[21 Inc](https://21.co/) is the creator of the 21 Bitcoin Computer.

## 21 Bitcoin Computer

21 Inc believes that satoshis--the smallest unit of BTC--will become a system resource used to pay for small tasks across the internet. One project built using the 21's computer, for example, uses the company's software to [sell API calls](https://github.com/joepickrell/genome-server-21) for satoshis. Another allows Twitter accounts to sell retweets for satoshis.

The 21 Bitcoin Computer is a computer that comes with a 50 Gh/s mining chip and also operates as a Bitcoin full node. The built-in mining chip provides the computer's owner with a constant stream of satoshis that can be used to pay for these small tasks.

The 21 Bitcoin Computer is available on [Amazon](http://www.runtogold.com/21computer) and costs $399.99.
