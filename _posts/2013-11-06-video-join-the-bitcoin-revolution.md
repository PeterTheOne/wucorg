<h2>TRANSCRIPT</h2>
<p>HSBC the banking giant has escaped indictment for laundering billions of dollars for Mexican drug cartels and groups linked to Al Qaeda.</p>
<p>To investigate the off-balance sheet transactions conducted by the Federal Reserve which according to Bloomberg now total nine trillion dollars, the Federal Reserve today is likely going to announce more money printing.  Whenever did I think that would in a completely, in unprecedented matter, resort to stealing money from people's bank account. They can only get three hundred euros per person per day per bank.</p>
<p>If there was a bank, a bank without building owners or employees, a bank where anyone could open an account. All accounts are completely free. And there are no mandatory fees. A bank that didn't require identification and had no forms to fill out. A bank without any arbitrary borders, fees restrictions or regulations. That opens for business 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and 365 days a year. A bank based on a revolutionary new currency. A currency that is virtually impossible to counterfeit.</p>
<p>That's not regulated by a CEO, politician or Central Bank. Rather by an elegant and unbiased mathematical equation. A currency more scarce than gold. You could lock with an invisible key and you could spend instantly at any time anywhere in the world without ever leaving your home. A currency where no one not even its creator has any more power than any other person. The first of its kind. System designed to create a truly free, open, fair, private, equal, decentralized and borderless network. To facilitate trade between the only two parties that matter. The buyer and the seller.  What if this existed today? Would you open an account?  </p>
<p>When I discovered Bitcoin, I realized that without exaggeration this is the most important invention in the history of the world since the internet. You can now send or receive payment with anyone else anywhere in the world. And it's impossible for anyone to block you from sending or receiving that payment. It's impossible for anyone to freeze your account. It's impossible for any third party to interject themselves into that transaction in any way whatsoever. And that's never existed for the entire history of the world and it's going to change everything.  Join the revolution!</p>
