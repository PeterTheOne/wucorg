<h2>TRANSCRIPT</h2>

Lyrics :

Skippin down the sidewalk the other day
Got my phone in my hand with my tunes on play
Lookin in my wallet app to see
If I wanna buy any more BTC

I'm checkin out Bitcoin market prices
Apple don't wannit on their devices
Governments they don't understand it
That's just how Satoshi planned it

Just like the central bank
They don't know what to think
They wanna control it
But they don't own it
Now the control, we stole it!

Wish I knew who to thank
For making me my own bank
Satoshi Nakamoto
A real life superhero

This is Satoshi's gift to the world!

[Bitcoin][Blockchain][Bitcoin] 1UP!

If you have some BTC
Please send it to my public key
So I can use my private to
..release the coins inside it ... wtf?

Liberated money was not an option
Up until Bitcoin's mass adoption
No more money for wars and evil
Bitcoin by and for the people

Just like the central bank
They don't know what to think
They wanna control it
But they don't own it
Now the control, we stole it!

Wish I knew who to thank
For making me my own bank
Satoshi Nakamoto
A real life superhero

This is Satoshi's gift to the world!
