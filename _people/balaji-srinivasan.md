## Quotes

On [closing Bitcoin loops](http://www.coindesk.com/21-ceo-balaji-srinivasan-bitcoin-job-fair/):

> If you're giving bitcoin and getting back dollars, this is not good for the price. If you have closed loops, you have something where you're getting value out of bitcoin without selling it.

On [21's micropayments API](https://medium.com/@21/a-bitcoin-miner-in-every-device-and-in-every-hand-e315b40f2821#.49c1an365):

> Historically, it has been difficult to get people to dig out their credit cards in order to purchase things online, particularly on mobile devices. The fixed cost of signup alone exceeds the benefit for the vast majority of sites. A continuously replenished stream of digital currency on your device generated by default from a 21 BitShare chip can change all that.
