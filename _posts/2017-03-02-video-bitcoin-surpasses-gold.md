<h2>TRANSCRIPT</h2>

While the central banks are busy bashing down the price of gold, bitcoin is still steadily rising. It was only a matter of time until BTC would surpass the price of gold, and today is that day. 

Dash is also performing quite well, surprisingly well actually. We'll see what happens in the next few days, who knows! 

Let's not forget about ETH either, it's rise in price is arguably much healthier than that of Dash.
