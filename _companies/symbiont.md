Symbiont is bridging the gap between the emerging blockchain ecosystem and Wall Street, with the first issuance and trading platform for Smart Securities.

## What is a Symbiont Smart Security®?

Symbiont’s proprietary Smart Security® technology allows complex financial instruments to be modeled in an easy to understand programming language and fully digitized onto a distributed ledger.

## SHARE DATA

Share and distribute ledger statuses and updates among a closed or open group of participants, securely and instantly.

## SAVE COSTS

Automate the complex, manual, back and middle office processes that largely account for the high costs associated with financial transactions.

## ELIMINATE TAMPERING

Enable the full instrument life cycle to be fully digitized and cryptographically verifiable.

## REDUCE RISK

Support electronic issuance, allocation, trading and corporate actions without having to trust and depend on a single partner or technology vendor.

## INCREASE TRANSPARENCY

All instrument states and history are viewable in real time by authorized participants. Gain immediate feedback for rapid planning and operational assurance.

## GROW AND ADAPT

Symbiont Smart Security® technology is separate from the underlying network, and can run on virtually any blockchain or distributed ledger system.
