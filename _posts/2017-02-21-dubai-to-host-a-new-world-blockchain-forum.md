<p>During first quarter of 2015, <a href="/the-first-twenty-bitcoin-documentaries/">blockchain technology</a> has been centered on mainstream in Dubai. Then this coming March 6, 2017,  Dubai will again be hosting with World Blockchain Forum in Burj Al Arab so delegates can be taught and capitalize on these ground-breaking technologies first hand. </p>

<h1>Blockchain Speed Up in Dubai</h1>

<p>The <a href="/how-an-etf-approval-could-impact-bitcoins-price-charts/">Cryptocurrency  solutions</a> popularity arises in Dubai very fast specially the Bitcoin and underlying blockchain protocols. Dubai's Crown Prince is also investing one billion Dirhams (275 million US Dollars) into Dubai’s fintech and blockchain sectors and has assurred to have all government documents detained on a blockchain protocol on 2020.</p>

<p>In order to bolster Dubai’s technological lead and research, <a href="/bitcoin-gambling-investments-312/">World Blockchain Forum</a> attendees will experience a day filled with crypto-industry luminaries and leaders in distributed ledger technology.</p>

<p>The event will tie up the participants and blockchain industry leaders to construct relationships. And these includes :</p>

<p>Director Generals, CEOs, CIOs, and COOs of the largest organizations in the Middle East and Europe, including Smart Dubai</p>

<p>DFF, Dubai Holdings, Emirates Airlines, DIFC, IBM, Microsoft, Visa, Deutsche Bank, EmiratesNBD, Bank of Canada, Danske Bank, Aramco, DMCC,</p>

<p>and more...</p>

<p>Instead of <a href="/bitcoin-gambling-investments-212/">initial exploratory stages</a>, the main focus on this year's World Blockchain Forum is the implementation and piloting of blockchain projects.</p>

<h1>Enormous Change  Inside the World’s Tech Landscape</h1>

<p>Moe Levin, producer of World Blockchain Forum informed WeUseCoins he looks forward to this year’s Dubai conference, stating:</p>

<p>Levin added: “As the industry has grown around the world, Dubai has not taken a backseat in the evolution and production of new use cases and piloting them. Smart Dubai and the Dubai Future Foundation have both announced that they will have all government documents on the Blockchain by 2020. </p>

<p>Customs and Immigration are piloting blockchain projects and Dubai Police are piloting new projects. There is not one government agency in Dubai that is not embracing the massive opportunity that innovation brings.”</p>

<p>The said event will be helpful to both <a href="/best-bitcoin-faucet-2016/">blockchain novices and experts</a>. participants from all around the globe  are place to be present at the WBF together with Dubai’s local government legislative body, financial organization, and academia, as well.</p>

<p>Tickets to the eventcan be purchased at keynote.ae. Keynote coordinators want Dubai attendees to “get [in on] the ground floor and spot themselves to capitalize on this enormous shift within the world’s monetary landscape.”</p>

<p>Obviously, <a href="/the-regain-of-bitcoin-will-it-be-strong-enough/">blockchain technology</a> is on its way to being a disruptive force in our global society. And, Dubai definitely wants its role in blockchain technology to be a ‘success story.’</p>
