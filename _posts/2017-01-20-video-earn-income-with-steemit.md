Steem is also a homophone for steam, which is frequently associated with power, and a step further, steam powered trains gave influence to English idioms, such as this conversation is <a href="/kraken-dao-trading/">picking up steam</a>.

<h2>TRANSCRIPT</h2>

Are you getting tired of logging onto Facebook, scrolling down your newsfeed, trying to find something worth your time to read? Are you realizing that quality content is rare on most social media outlets? 

Do you have a knack for taking photos? Do you enjoy creating funny or educational videos, but the profits from youtube are leaving you feeling…broke? Are you a great story teller or writer? Is cooking you’re niche? Do you enjoy analyzing graphs? Are you knowledgable about crypto? …Do you want to be?

Now I want you to imagine logging onto a website that is teeming with all different sorts of categories for you to browse, read, learn from, and have discussions with others. 

Imagine creating a post on this site about anything that suits your interests. 

Imagine getting paid for it.

Now wake up and check out www.steemit.com.

24 hours after you submit a post, if it gains enough up votes for you to make a profit, you will see your income deposited into your wallet that is connected to your account. 

If you’re interested in cashing out your profits, you will also need an account with an online exchange, like www.poloniex.com or www.bittrex.com 

This is where you would send your steem or steem dollars (SBD) so you can exchange it for bitcoin or ether, or any crypto of your choice. 

If you want to get your profit deposited into your bank account you can create an account with www.coinbase.com. 

Coinbase is available in 33 different countries and it accepts bitcoin and ether, where you can sell it for USD or whichever currency is appropriate for you.
