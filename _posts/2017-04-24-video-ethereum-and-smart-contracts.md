<h2>TRANSCRIPT</h2>

Ethereum is #2 on list at coinmarketcap.com. 

The current price of each Ether is $50 with the circulating supply of ether tokens at 91 million, the market cap for ether is 4.5 billion, and the 24 hour volume is around 52.9 million.

Ethereum is a blockchain based, open sourced, software platform that focuses on allowing developers to create and launch decentralized applications, also known as DAPPS.

Vitalik Buterin is the co-founder of Ethereum, heâ€™s a Russian Programmer and also a co-founder of Bitcoin magazine. 

Smart contracts refers to computer code that facilitates the exchange of money, content, property, shares, or anything of value. 

When run on the blockchain a smart contract becomes like a self-operating computer program that automatically executes when specific conditions are met. Because smart contracts run on the blockchain, they run exactly as programmed without any possibility of censorship, downtime, fraud or third party interference

The Ethereum Virtual Machine makes the process of creating blockchain applications much easier and efficient than ever before. Instead of having to build an entirely original blockchain for each new application, Ethereum enables the development of potentially thousands of different applications all on one platform.
