<a href="https://custostech.com/">Custos Media Technologies</a> develops cutting edge digital content distribution solutions that allows content owners to distribute, manage, and protect sensitive media. The innovative core technology gives a new level of protection to the owners of any project – whether a large ebook publisher, a small indie film producer, or anything in between. Anywhere sensitive digital media moves, Custos can protect it.

The company was spun out of the prestigious New Media research lab at Stellenbosch University, South Africa. The underlying technology was invented by an experienced cross-disciplinary team specialising in signal processing, distribution systems, cryptocurrency, machine learning, and media and behavioral economics.

Since 2013 the growing team has developed the product and business to service film and ebook customers on three continents.

The Custos team comes from a range of industry, entrepreneurial, and research backgrounds. The founding team combines expertise and experience in engineering and economics – the essence of the core technology. The team is driven to change the way media is distributed, protected, and consumed.
