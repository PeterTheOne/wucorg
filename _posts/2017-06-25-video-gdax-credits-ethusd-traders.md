<p>GDAX, one of the world leading digital assets exchanges is crediting customer accounts who were affected by the GDAX ETHUSD Ethereum flash crash on June 21. This is a huge positive move by a major cryptocurrency exchange, and while GDAX is in no way liable for the losses of customers, They are taking a hit personally and refunding traders.
