[BitGo](https://www.bitgo.com/) launched in 2013 and was the first multisignature Bitcoin wallet. Its API and Bitcoin wallet power some of the world's largest and most popular Bitcoin companies and exchanges, like Bitstamp, [Kraken](/kraken-bitcoin-exchange/), Bitfinex, BitQuick, [ShapeShift](/shapeshift/), and UnoCoin.

## Web Wallet

BitGo offers a free, multisig web [wallet](https://www.bitgo.com/wallet). Anyone with an email address can sign up in seconds. 

## BitGo Instant

BitGo instant is one of BitGo's most popular features. Regular Bitcoin transactions take on average 10 minutes to confirm. Using BitGo instant, any business that accepts BitGo instant transactions will instead be able to enjoy near-instant Bitcoin transactions. This works because BitGo guarantees that it will never sign a double-spend transaction. 

BitGo instant is a useful feature for Bitcoin exchanges. Instead of making customers wait 30 minutes to an hour for deposited funds to confirm, users can fund and start trading almost instantly.
