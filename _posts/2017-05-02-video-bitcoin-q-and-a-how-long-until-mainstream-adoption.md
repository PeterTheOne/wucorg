<p>How long until mainstream adoption? Previous revolutions in money. In the mid 90s, you still couldn't pay with a credit card in many places. I predict it will take 15-20 years for mainstream adoption of Bitcoin. </p>

<p>We are in a race because governments around the world are trying to ban cash and force us to adopt a different sort of digital currency with complete surveillance, where they can flip and switch and you will no longer exist as a person if you doing anything they consider radical. </p>

<p>Adoption patterns and the Gini coefficient. The ownership of Bitcoin is not as diverse as it should be, primarily because of the way it grew. But people who got in early and took the risk have been enormously rewarded; no one's coming to bail out Bitcoin.</p>
