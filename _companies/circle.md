Circle is a Bitcoin broker and digital payments company. Although Bitcoin is not mentioned on its home page, Circle is one of the easiest places to [buy bitcoins](/en/how-buy-bitcoins-online-best-bitcoin-exchange-rate-bitcoin-price/) in the United States.

## Bitcoin Broker

Circle allows its users to buy and [sell bitcoins](/how-to-sell-bitcoins/) online. Among U.S. Bitcoin exchanges, it has some of the lowest fees, since it sells bitcoins at just 0.5% above market rate. 

Since [April 2016](http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/bitcoin-graduate-circle-launches-free-social-payment-app-uk-barclays-1553353), residents of the UK can also use Circle to buy and sell bitcoins with pounds. 

## Bitcoin Wallet & Digital Wallet

Users can select to store balances in bitcoin, dollars, or pounds. Payments received to fiat wallets will have the incoming payment automatically converted to fiat currency. Non-bitcoin accounts can also spend balances as Bitcoin at any [Bitcoin accepting merchant](/en/merchant-tools/).

Although Circle launched as a [Bitcoin wallet](/en/find-the-best-bitcoin-wallet/) and exchange, it now appears to be focused on competing with payment apps like PayPal's [Venmo](https://venmo.com/).
