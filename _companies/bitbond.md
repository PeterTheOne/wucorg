<a href="https://www.bitbond.com/">Bitbond</a> is the first global marketplace lending platform for small business loans. We leverage blockchain technology to connect creditworthy borrowers with individual and institutional investors.

By innovating in the fields of payments and credit scoring, Bitbond makes financial inclusion a reality around the world. All payment transactions on Bitbond are conducted via the bitcoin blockchain. Therefore our service is available worldwide via the internet and is independent of banks.

In order to score borrowers who are not covered by conventional credit bureaus, we use alternative data for credit scoring. This includes transactions of small business owners from accounts like eBay, Amazon, Etsy, MercadoLibre, Shopify, PayPal, bank accounts and many others. The data gets evaluated with our proprietary machine learning algorithm.

As an investor on Bitbond you can either pick the loans you like to fund manually or you use our convenient AutoInvest tool. AutoInvest lets you create a diversified portfolio of loans according to your preferences in an automated way. The great benefit for investors who use Bitbond is that you can create a portfolio of loans that is diversified across many different countries.

Bitbond is incorporated in Berlin, Germany and is a fully regulated financial institution with its own licence.

Bitbond's mission is to make investing and financing globally accessible.
