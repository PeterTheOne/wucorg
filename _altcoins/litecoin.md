<p>Litecoin is a <a href="/video-p2p-money-historical-context/">peer-to-peer Internet currency</a> that enables instant, near-zero cost payments to anyone in the world.</p>

<p>Litecoin is an open source, global payment network that is fully decentralized without any central authorities. Mathematics secures the network and empowers individuals to control their own finances.</p>

<p>Litecoin features faster transaction confirmation times and improved storage efficiency than the leading math-based currency.</p>

<p>With substantial industry support, trade volume and liquidity, Litecoin is a proven medium of commerce <a href="/ten-reasons-hire-bitcoin/">complementary to Bitcoin</a>.</p>

<center><img src="/images/litecoin-vs-bitcoin.jpg" alt="what is litecoin"/></center>

<p>The Litecoin blockchain is capable of handling higher transaction volume than its counterpart - Bitcoin. Due to more frequent block generation, the network supports more transactions without a need to modify the software in the future. As a result, merchants get faster confirmation times, while still having ability to wait for more confirmations when selling bigger ticket items.</p>

<p>Miners are currently awarded with 50 new Litecoins per block, an amount which gets halved roughly every 4 years (every 840,000 blocks). The Litecoin network is therefore scheduled to produce 84 million Litecoins, which is 4 times as many currency units as Bitcoin.</p>

<p>Wallet encryption allows you to secure your wallet, so that you can view transactions and your account balance, but are required to enter your password before <a href="/how-to-buy-litecoins/">spending Litecoins</a>. This provides protection from wallet-stealing viruses and trojans as well as a sanity check before sending payments.</p>

<p>Litecoin is an open source software project released under the MIT/X11 license which gives you the power to run, modify, and copy the software and to distribute, at your option, modified copies of the software. The software is released in a transparent process that allows for independent verification of binaries and their corresponding source code.</p>

<h2 id="getting">Getting Started With Litecoin?</h2>

<p>If you are so familiar with using Bitcoin, Litecoin will amaze you with some few things also. If you don’t have idea on what is Bitcoin yet, you can read some of our articles about Bitcoin. Anything on the guidelines is also applicable in Litecoin.</p>

<p>The essential desktop application is a change of Bitcoin-QT customer, and can be downloaded from Litecoin's site. This can likewise go about as a wallet. Other Litecoin wallets are accessible on We Use Litecoin. </p>

<p>There are essential contrasts however. First off, while Bitcoin has a top of 21 million coins, Litecoin will be four times bigger at 84 million. </p>

<p>Much the same as Bitcoin, Litecoin has begun with a mining prize of 50 coins for every square. Be that as it may, the Litecoin reward will split each 840,000 pieces. Again this is four times bigger than the 210,000 piece edge in Bitcoin. </p>

<p>The <a href="/bitcoin-learn-foreign-exchange-market/">exchange charge for Litecoin</a> is 0.02 LTC, which is proportionately higher than the base Bitcoin expense of 0.0001 BTC, in any case, remember that a Litecoin is at present worth 0.019 BTC. </p>

<p>The factor of four contrasts amongst Litecoin and Bitcoin endures into the square time as well. The square time is the time it should take excavators to affirm a piece on the piece chain. </p>

<p>For Bitcoin this is 10 minutes, yet for Litecoin it is only 2.5 minutes. This implies Litecoin can possibly be more appealing to vendors as there will be less time to hold up to guarantee that an installment has been gotten from clients.</p>

<h2 id="buy">How To Buy Litecoin?</h2>

<p>Most people think of Litecoin as silver to Bitcoin's gold. In coinmarketcap recently, it is the third one setting from top, Bitcoin is the first and Ethereum is the second. Its place is consistent since in 2015 it is also third when Ripple sitting as the second of Bitcoin. </p>

<p>Litecoin was created as a <a href="/ethereum-wallets/">Bitcoin contrasting option</a> to address some of that digital currency's apparent weaknesses. It was intended to be "lightweight" and more inexhaustible than Bitcoin. Furthermore, it utilizes scrypt as its verification of-work calculation, which was expected to make it impenetrable to ASIC mining, albeit a few organizations say they are intending to dispatch scrypt ASIC diggers sooner rather than later.</p>

<p>An aggregate of 84 million Litecoins can be created on the system (compared with 21 million BTC), which was intended to process blocks quicker than Bitcoin. In the event that you might want to discover more about Litecoin, at that point read this more itemized acquaintance on how to begin. </p>

<p>A few purposes of note before you purchase Litecoin: </p>

<p>Litecoin turned into an expanding magnet for theorists after Bitcoin's value surge in November 2013, however costs have since dropped in parallel. You can expect the two cryptographic forms of money costs to a great extent move a similar way, in spite of the fact that Litecoin's esteem is by a wide margin the lower of the two. </p>

<p>Seasoned Bitcoin financial specialists ought to experience no difficulty adjusting to Litecoin, however tenderfoot speculators may not discover it as simple, as the framework is less settled than that of Bitcoin. </p>

<p>An option method for picking up Litecoins is by mining them utilizing standard registering gear. </p>

<p>Continuously do your own examination before contributing assets, and don't chance sums you can't stand to lose.</p>

<p>On the off chance that you know about the dangers, in the event that you've done a considerable measure of research and you are as yet eager to enter the <a href="/openbazaar-guide/">Litecoin advertise</a>, there are various potential traps and issues that should be tended to. </p>

<h4>Cash for Litecoins or Bitcoins for Litecoins? </h4>

<p>Purchasing Litecoins is not as direct as purchasing Bitcoins, but rather this is not really astounding given the lesser-created Litecoin foundation. One of the least demanding methods for purchasing Litecoins is to just buy them with Bitcoins – this approach additionally happens to be the speediest, and for most clients it will be the least expensive choice. </p>

<p>Anybody with a reserve of Bitcoins can without much of a stretch utilize them to buy Litecoins on various trades: </p>

<ul>
<li>BTC-e </li>
<li>Kraken </li>
<li>Cryptsy </li>
<li>Others are recorded on the Litecoin Wiki. </li>
</ul>

<p>At present, one of the greatest issues confronting Litecoin is the absence of trades willing to bargain in it. </p>

<p>There are around two dozen Litecoin trades, however the greater part of them just permit BTC/LTC changes, influencing the purchasing to process lumbering. </p>

<p>BTC-E, Bitfinex, Crypto-Trade and <a href="/best-bitcoin-exchange/">Kraken</a> offer Litecoins for euros, dollars and roubles, however accessibility relies upon your area. For instance, UK investors can purchase Litecoins specifically from Bittylicious and BitBargain with a residential managing an account exchange, however this is not the situation in many nations. Australians can change over to and from AUD at CoinSpot. </p>

<p>You can purchase Litecoins for fiat on these trades: </p>
<ul>
<li>BTC-e </li>
<li>Bitfinex </li>
<li>Kraken </li>
<li>BitBargain UK </li>
<li>Bittlylicious UK </li>
</ul>
<p>You may figure the most direct approach to buy is purchase Litecoin through fiat wire exchange utilizing a trade, however this can be a dull procedure for various reasons. Some major Bitcoin trades like BTC China and <a href="http://geni.us/coinbase">Coinbase</a> don't deal with Litecoin exchanges at show. </p>

<p>Speed is the most clear favorable position of utilizing Bitcoin to purchase Litecoin. In principle, it should take minutes, while worldwide wire exchanges can take days to clear and possibly acquire extra expenses. The set number of Litecoin trades implies that by far most of potential speculators need to depend on universal exchanges. </p>

<p>An option is to purchase Bitcoin locally, swearing off the bother of wiring cash abroad, and changing over it into Litecoin. The upside is that you will get your Bitcoin sooner and potentially show signs of improvement cost when you change over it, if Litecoin's esteem keeps going up. The drawback? You are probably going to pay more for Bitcoin on the off chance that you are restricted to the neighborhood showcase. </p>

<h4>Litecoin Wallets Can Be Risky </h4>

<p>A number of trades offer online Litecoin wallets, however they are not really rich arrangements. Numerous clients will need something more secure, similar to frosty disconnected wallets. Fortunately, Litecoin highlights worked in encryption that you can use to ensure your wallet in only a couple of snaps. </p>

<p>So, the decision of <a href="/bitcoin-brazil/">Litecoin wallets</a> is somewhat restricted contrasted with those accessible for Bitcoin. Numerous clients utilize the authority Litecoin-Qt desktop customer, however it has what's coming to its of quirks, including revealed synchronizing issues. Electrum additionally has an offering (OS X/Linux/Windows) utilizing a 12-word security passphrase (or 'seed') to ensure your record.</p>
 
<p>A couple of online wallets charge clients for exchanges and even plain stockpiling, so make certain to peruse the fine print. </p>

<p>For longer-term icy stockpiling, you may need to setup a Litecoin paper wallet. </p>

<p>It is likewise conceivable to get Visa quality 'paper wallet' cards from Crypto Coin Wallet Cards, while a couple of littler organizations are as of now offering physical Litecoins or coin multi dimensional images.</p>

It's additionally been included onto <a href="http://geni.us/coinbase">Coinbase</a>.

<p>Outstanding amongst other spots to spend your Litecoin is on VPN. VPN and Litecoin go well together. As it were, they are the two innovations of the current web.

Sadly, there aren't a huge amount of outside the box or lesser known sites that acknowledge Litcoin, and a couple have even closed down, however you can pay for Steam Games with Bitcoin. </p>

<p>Bitpay and Steam have cooperated together through Bitpay, so in the event that you need to pay for a computer game with Litecoin, essentially utilize an exchanging site like Gdax.com to exchange LTC into BTC to make an installment.</p> 

<h4>4. Gift Cards</h4>

<p>While it requires a record, and isn't as simple as simply "purchasing something" with Litecoin, it's still genuinely uncomplicated and a simple approach to spend your LTC where you need to.</p>

<h2 id="mining">What Is Litecoin Mining?</h2>

<center><img src="/images/litecoin-mining-001.jpg" alt="what is litecoin"/></center>

<p>If you have never mined Litecoins before then you can follow these steps to test your hardware:</p>

<p>If you want to <a href="/video-bitcoin-bytes/">mine Litecoins with your CPU</a>, double click on the file "MineWithCPU.bat" from the folder "Mine Litecoins with CPU". If your hardware can handle it, your computer will begin mining Litecoins for a test worker I've set up at the mining pool POOL-X. It could take several minutes before you get a share though. Mining Litecoins with your CPU isn't very effective, but you can experience how it works by executing this file.</p>

<p>If you want to mine Litecoins with your GPU, double click on the file "MineWithAMDGPU.bat" from the folder "Mine Litecoins with GPU/AMD" if your graphic card has been manufactured by AMD (Ati). If your card has been made by Nvidia, double click on the file "MineWithNvidiaGPU.bat" from the folder "Mine Litecoins with GPU/Nvidia". </p>

<p>If your hardware can handle it, and the miner I've included recognizes correctly the graphical card you've got on your computer, it will begin mining Litecoins for another test worker I've set up at the mining pool POOL-X. It could take minutes before you get a share though. Mining Litecoins with your GPU is the way to go nowadays. </p>

<p>There are people who have several graphic cards set up to mine Litecoins at the same time, so it might take you several days to get an entire Litecoin with a single GPU. You can experience how GPU mining works on your card by executing the corresponding file though.</p>

<p>Now that you have tested your hardware and know you can mine Litecoins correctly, you may join a mining pool and change the name of my workers and the URL of POOL-X which you can see if you edit the files "MineWithCPU.bat" and "MineWith(AMD/Nvidia)GPU.bat". Write instead the names of the workers you created on your pool of choice and its URL:port so as you can mine Litecoins for yourself (this URL:port information is given to you when you make an account on a <a href="/video-rick-falkvinge-pirate-party/">mining poo</a>l).</p>

<p>If you don't know how to join a mining pool then this may be a problem.</p>

<p>If you want to mine Litecoins solo (it's a possibility if you have VERY good hardware), follow these steps:</p>

<p>Copy the file "Litecoin.conf" provided in this package to your Litecoin working directory (most likely "C:\Users\YOURNAME\AppData\Roaming\Litecoin"). Now navigate to the directory where Litecoin was installed (most likely "C:\Program Files (x86)\Litecoin\") and execute Litecoin-qt.exe. Wait until you are fully synchronized with the network.</p>

<p>Execute the file "SoloMineWithCPU.bat" from the folder "Mine Litecoins with CPU", the file "SoloMineWith(AMD/Nvidia)GPU.bat" from the folder "Mine Litecoins with GPU/(AMD/Nvidia)" or both of them. Your computer resources will begin mining Litecoins. It could take you a LOT of time before you find a full block. Or maybe you are extremely lucky and find one in one minute. It's impossible to know!</p>

<p>Note 1: the miner provided for CPU mining is Pooler's CPUminer 2.3.2, the one for AMD GPU mining is CGMiner 3.7.2 and the one for <a href="/all-about-cryptocoin-mining/">Nvidia GPU mining</a> is CudaMiner-2013-11-15. Other miners exist which might suit your hardware better and increase your mining speed.</p>

<p>Note 2: some antivirus programs consider all cryptocoin miners malware. They are not! The problem is that some bad people included them inside other legit packages of software so as they would mine for them on other computers without their owner's knowledge. When they were found, antivirus companies labeled them as malicious software.</p>
