OKCoin is one of China's largest Bitcoin companies. Its Chinese Yuan Bitcoin exchange is one of the world's largest, while its USD Bitcoin exchange is also one of the top three USD exchanges.  

## CNY Bitcoin Exchange

OKCoin's CNY Bitcoin exchange is the global leader in [Bitcoin exchange](/en/how-buy-bitcoins-online-best-bitcoin-exchange-rate-bitcoin-price/) trading volume. 

Bobby Lee, CEO of [BTCC](/btcc/), disputes these numbers and [claims](http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/btcc-chief-bobby-lee-bitcoin-not-anti-bank-its-pro-innovation-1525964) that OKCoin and Huobi are "artificially inflating their volumes through the technique of wash trades".

It is impossible to know for sure whether or not OKCoin's volumes are fake. It is known, however, that OKCoin and other Chinese exchanges have no trading fees. This makes it easier for traders to create wash trades back and forth. 

## USD Bitcoin Exchange

OKCoin's USD exchange [trades](http://data.bitcoinity.org/markets/volume/30d/USD?c=e&t=a) about 8,000 bitcoins per day. Its futures, margin trading, and lending features make it popular among traders. 

## Bitcoin.com Debate

OKCoin once leased the Bitcoin.com domain name from Bitcoin entrepreneur [Roger Ver](/roger-ver/). After an argument over payments and terms of the agreement, Ver took back control of the site.
