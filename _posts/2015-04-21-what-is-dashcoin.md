Dash (DASH) is an open sourced, privacy-centric digital currency with instant transactions.
It allows you to keep your finances private as you make transactions without waits, similar to cash.

<h2>Darkcoin was rebranded into DASH</h2>
Keep your payments private so nobody can track you thanks to Darksend. Much lower than banks or credit cards, often even free. Payments are received instantly by the other party thanks to InstantX. Uses a decentralized network, so no centralized third party to trust. Advanced encryption and a 2-tier network for complete security. You can send money anywhere in the world.
<h2>What is Dash</h2>
Dash (DASH) is a privacy-centric digital currency with instant transactions. It is based on the Bitcoin software, but it has a two tier network that makes possible to improve upon it. Dash allows you to remain anonymous while you make transactions, similar to cash. With Bitcoin, transactions are published to the blockchain and you can prove who made them or to whom, but with Dash the anonymization technology makes it impossible to trace them.
<p>This is important because the blockchain is accessible to anyone with an internet connection – a significant drawback for those don’t wish their transaction history and balances to be publicly available. Dash does this through a mixing protocol utilizing an innovate decentralized network of servers called Masternodes, avoiding the need for a trusted third party that could compromise the integrity of the system. Dash transactions are almost instantly confirmed by the Masternodes network. This is a great improvement on Bitcoin’s system, where confirmations take much long because all the work is done by the miners.
<p>
<h2>What is DarkSend?</h2>
Darksend has made some significant advances, and we’re happy to say that we’re closing in on a finished product.
<p>With the introduction of Release Candidate 5 (RC5), the Dash client stores pre-mixed, denominated Dashs in the user’s wallet, to be used instantly at any time the user desires. The mixing and denomination process is seamless, automatic, and requires no intervention on the part of the user. With RC5, the amount that users can send via Darksend is limited only by the available balance in their wallet. Here’s how it works:
<p>Every 10 blocks, user clients network-wide will send any unmixed, traceable Dashs in their possession through an anonymization phase. In this phase, Masternodes are used in chained succession to mix the coins they receive from the network and break them down into homogenous denominations. After being processed by a minimum of 2 Masternodes, the coins are either sent to the next Masternode in the chain or back to the user’s wallet at randomly generated change addresses.
<p>Depending on the desired depth of security and privacy, users may select between 2 and 8 “hops” to successive Masternodes before their coins are sent back to the client. Hops are made every 10 blocks, so anonymization at a depth of 2 hops will take 2*2.5=5.0 minutes, 3 hops 3*2.5=7.5 minutes, and so on. The desired mixing depth can be selected in the client GUI.
<p>At the end of the anonymization phase, the user’s coins are returned to their client at randomly generated change addresses. When the user wishes to make a transaction, the client forwards the intended amount from these anonymous change addresses directly to the intended receiver’s address. There is no direct involvement of of Masternodes in the final person-to-person transaction.
<p>Proof of payment will work as it always has: a user can see the send transaction with the receiver’s address in their own wallet, and the blockchain will show that the receiver’s address received an input in the corresponding amount.
<h2>X11 Chained Hashing Algorithm</h2>
X11 is a widely used hashing algorithm created by Dash core developer Evan Duffield. X11’s chained hashing algorithm approach utilizes a sequence of eleven scientific hashing algorithms for the proof-of-work. This is so that the processing distribution is fair and coins will be distributed in much the same way Bitcoin’s were originally. ASICs will be much more difficult to make for these algorithms and should take years.
<p>With chained hashing, high end CPUs give an average return similar to that of GPUs. An added benefit of the algorithm is that GPUs require approximately 30% less wattage and run 30-50% cooler than they do with Scrypt.
<p>
<h2>What is a Multi-Phased Fork (“Spork”)</h2>
In response to unforeseen issues with the rollout of RC3, the Dash development team created a mechanism by which updated code is released to the network, but not immediately made active (or “enforced”).
<p>Communication is sent out to users informing them of the change and the need for them to update their clients. Those who update their clients run the new code, but in the event of errors occurring with that new code, the client’s blocks are not rejected by the network and unintended forks are avoided. Data about the error can then be collected and forwarded to the development team. Once the development team is satisfied with the new code’s stability in the mainnet environment – and once acceptable network consensus is attained – enforcement of the updated code can be activated remotely. Should problems arise, the code can be deactivated in the same manner, without the need for a network-wide rollback or client update.
<p>This innovation allows for far smoother transitions than in the traditional hard fork paradigm, as well as the collection of test data in the live network environment. We set out with the intention of calling this method of updating the “Soft Fork”, but the Dash community quickly dubbed it the “Spork” and the name seems to have stuck.
<h2>Getting started with Litecoin</h2>
It is very easy to start using DASH.

<ul><li>Step 1: Get A DASH Wallet.</li>
<li>Step 2: Get Some DASH at the <a href="https://www.kraken.com/">best DASH exchange</a>.</li>
<li>Step 3: Use Your DASH.</li>
<li>Step 4: Stay Up-to-Date.</li></ul>
<h2>What is DASH mining?</h2>
Dash uses a special algorithm called X11 for the proof of work. X11 is one of the innovations introduced by Dash and has been widely adopted in the cryptocurrency community since its launch.
<p>Dash can currently be mined both with GPUs and CPUs (mining hardware comparison here). The characteristics of X11 make it very unlikely that ASICs will be developed to mine it, at least in the short term.
