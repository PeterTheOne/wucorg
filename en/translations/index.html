Please take care to provide accurate translations based on the English version of WeUseCoins and to respect the guidelines in the README. Thanks for your help!
<h3><em>What is Bitcoin?</em> | Video</h3>
The WeUseCoins video subtitles have been translated into dozens of languages, see the <a href="/en/materials">materials page</a>. You will also find the sound effects on this page, which you can use to record the video in your own language with an editing software such as audacity.
