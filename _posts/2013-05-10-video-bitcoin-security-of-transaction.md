<p>A detailed explanation of what makes bitcoin transaction <a href="/what-are-sidechains/">block chains secure</a>. The hash includes the "merkle root" in addition to the transaction. This is dependent on all previous blocks and, yes, this is what stops changing old blocks. If you try to put in fake blocks you can only add them at the end of the chain and you must have the longest chain for it to be accepted by the nodes so you have to create blocks faster than the rest of network combined.</p>
