<p>The mechanics of a <a href="/isle-of-man-blockchain-cluster-expansion/">bitcoin transaction block chain</a>, which is a construct that is generated by bitcoin miners and functions as a global ledger for recording and validating bitcoins. You could theoretically encounter strange situations like this if not all nodes could communicate with each other. However, once there are two "different" chains out there, (honest) bitcoin mining nodes will start building on top of the one with the most work put into it.</p>
