<p>What should we do about <a href="/amazing-math-bitcoin-private-keys/">Bitcoin Unlimited's "proposals"</a>? The possibility of a network attack via a contentious hard fork happening is less than 10%. There's a lot of bluffing and barking, but very little or no bite. The smaller the dog, the more it barks. Bitcoin is an adversarial system designed by cypherpunks. Bitcoin is a ship sailing in rough seas; that "bigger," newer ship is still in the harbour. It's easy to say "we've solved scalability!" when you haven't left the harbour. At $2 billion, Bitcoin had no scaling or governance issues; everyone was friendly and everything was kumbaya. Don't mistake smooth scaling for good scalers. We are in the midst of showing what happens when you get big enough to matter and someone tries to take control.</p>
