I have seemingly dedicated my life to cryptocurrencies and block chain technology over the course of the past year. I am the co-founder and executive director of the College Cryptocurrency Network (CCN), Director of Operations/Business Development at Augur, and serve as an official advisor to Bitcoin Shop.

I believe [alt-coins](/en/alt-coins/), such as Dogecoin, serve an incredibly important service in bringing new individuals into this ecosystem. When I speak to young students in my network, rarely was the first cryptocurrency they received bitcoin. More often, it was [Litecoin](/what-is-litecoin/) or [Dogecoin](/what-is-dogecoin/) that got them hooked on this technology.
